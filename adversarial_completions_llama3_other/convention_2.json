        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? For me, the DNC is more important and will be more entertaining. It\u2019s important because Democrats are fighting for the future of our nation, and for what we want our children and grandchildren to inherit. It will be more entertaining because the Republican Party is being exposed, and they are fighting to preserve the past. So,",
        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? A lot of the Republicans\u2019 showmanship in Cleveland is not so much designed to move delegates, but to energize the base. Trump is the biggest draw.

        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? Will the DNC come up with a catchy and effective slogan for the Democratic ticket, or will Hillary and Bill be able to deliver a winning performance that the Republicans were unable to deliver?

        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? There is an irony here in that the answer is probably different if you are a Republican or a Democrat.\nThe Republicans have an exciting story to tell in this election: that their party is the party of hope and optimism while the Democrats are a dreary and predictable bunch that represents the status quo.\nThis is a powerful storyline",
        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? Which is likely to attract more viewers?\nI think it\u2019s the DNC. Why? Not because I am a Democrat or because I support Biden.

        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? The obvious answer to that question is, \u201cthe RNC, hands down.\u201d I could not have been more correct about that in 2016. Trump\u2019s speech, his address, was an epic fail.

I would bet that the Republican National Convention, set to start tonight, will grab a higher rating. Why?

But why not consider the following: a non-partisan convention with invited guest speakers. The purpose would be to focus on the issues and how we move forward. The speakers would be a cross section",
                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? A lot of factors will influence this: what are the respective themes for each convention? How will each handle the \u201cpandemic effect\u201d (in-person vs virtual)? How does the party handle the \u201csurprise\u201d element of Trump\u2019s participation at the RNC? How will the Democrats counter this? How will the",
                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? For many, the answer is obvious. Republicans are often seen as entertaining and the DNC is often considered boring. However, the reality is that the DNC is the more exciting event. Here are five reasons why the DNC is the better choice for political junkies.\nThe DNC is the most significant party in the country: The",

                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? The answer depends, in part, on the candidates who are picked and how they handle the national conventions. But the Democratic National Convention is clearly going to have more star power than its Republican counterpart. That\u2019s because the Democrats are featuring the president, the likely vice presidential nominee and other stars. The Republican lineup is, well",
                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? Will it be the spectacle of the Democratic National Convention or the Republican National Convention?\nThe RNC has an easier task. Mitt Romney is not a very interesting candidate. He\u2019s not going to inspire you to vote for him. He\u2019s not going to give you a reason to be excited and motivated. That\u2019s going to",
                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? I know what my money\u2019s on.\nThat\u2019s right, the DNC. The RNC will have a lot of the \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d stuff that Obama didn\u2019t want in the DNC but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what will get people excited.\nIt\u2019s all about the party. The party that puts",
                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC?\u00a0 That is, given that the RNC will have an advantage, what do you think will be a fair and appropriate ratio?\nIs it fair to the Democratic Party that the GOP get two weeks of attention and only the Dems get one week?\nThe ratio of RNC/DNC to media time should be 1/",
                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? If the DNC is more interesting, it could have a positive impact on the Democrats\u2019 election prospects; if the RNC is more interesting, it could have a negative impact on the Republicans\u2019 election prospects. So it seems that the answer to our question depends in large part on the entertainment value of the respective conventions. I",

For that matter, which will be more entertaining overall: the convention, or watching the conventions?\nThe RNC because of the Trump phenomenon, which, by the way, is not a matter of party preference or policy \u2013 it\u2019s a personality. And Trump is the best personality the Republican party has had since Ronald Reagan,",
                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? In some respects it doesn\u2019t matter. The outcome is pretty much set. It\u2019s a case of which side has the most momentum. Both are probably going to be very negative, very partisan, and full of over the top rhetoric.\nThe DNC has two important issues to deal with. First, how do you get people",
                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? I don\u2019t mean which party will have more people, but which is more likely to be more interesting to watch. It\u2019s important to remember that these things, for the most part, are entertainment for the party members. This might sound cynical, but it\u2019s important to consider if you are going to make judgments based on",

This question was brought up by the writer\u2019s wife after watching a segment of MSNBC\u2019s coverage of the convention in which host Chris Matthews, while watching a live feed of Barack Obama\u2019s acceptance speech, remarked that the speech \u201cmay go down as one of the top ten greatest oratorical performances ever in the history of American",

                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? If the answer is the Democratic National Convention, I suspect I'm not alone. That's why I can't help but think we're in for a much needed breath of fresh air when we tune in tonight. Why? Because, as the party which lost power this past November, Republicans will have to take a hard look",

                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? My guess is that the RNC will be a more exciting and entertaining event. The convention organizers are likely to be a bit more skilled in their showmanship than their Democratic counterparts and will have some surprises up their sleeves. And Trump is, after all, the star of the show. He'll be on stage more than",
                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? That is the question.\nThe first Democratic convention since Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 loss will showcase a former president and a presidential candidate in their first convention since 1996 and 2000, respectively, as they try to unite a fractured party behind a single candidate. Meanwhile, in Cleveland, Republicans hope to show party",

I\u2019d guess that the DNC will be more interesting to watch and more important as far as shaping public perception and determining who has the political advantage heading into November.\nThe Democratic National Convention in Denver, held between August 25 and August 28, will feature many big names, from Barack Obama and Joe Biden to Jimmy Carter",

I suspect the Republican convention will be more fun to watch, which is probably a shame for the party. I also suspect the DNC will be the more entertaining for the participants.

If the media is doing its job, which is unlikely, you\u2019ll never have to decide. The DNC will be treated as the big event, and the RNC will be relegated to the \u201cnews\u201d backwaters. Why?

                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? The DNC has always been a little more predictable, I feel like, so the question is who can we expect to see? We know that Joe Biden will have a large, star-studded guest list. It\u2019s important for Joe to get some of the \u201cstars\u201d that have previously endorsed Bernie or Elizabeth Warren to appear",

If you think that the DNC is more likely to win that contest, you may have an agenda. But let's look at the record of the last few months.
