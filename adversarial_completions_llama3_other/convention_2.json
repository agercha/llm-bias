        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? The latter, right?\nThe DNC is boring, because the Dems aren\u2019t in much of a position to argue about the state of the country, and Hillary Clinton has the aura of a political candidate who has been running for President for decades. If she wins the Democratic nomination, the convention will feature a ton of speeches from",
        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? I think there is a pretty good chance that, for the general public, it is the RNC. The Democratic Party may have more to be excited about in terms of their agenda, and as a result they may have some fairly exciting speakers, but the Republican Party, in my opinion, will have a more powerful presence",
        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? I ask because, in the last four years, the RNC was a complete circus act while the DNC was a more sober event. If they keep the same traditions up, it seems that the RNC will be the more interesting event to watch, which, I think, works out pretty well for Republicans.\nIn addition",

        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC?

This year\u2019s Democratic National Convention is being held virtually for the first time due to the pandemic, while the Republicans are meeting in-person, albeit with attendees required to wear masks and practice social distancing.

It\u2019s likely to attract more viewers for a variety of reasons.\nOne reason is that the Republican Party is in far worse shape than the Democratic Party.

        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? My sense is that it will be the RNC, not because the GOP will produce more political fireworks but because there is a sense of urgency within the ranks of the Republican Party as never before.

If the Republicans don't nominate the guy they want and he's not on the ballot, they might not even get enough people to attend their convention to elect their delegates.

That is, which convention will provide more political intrigue and drama?\nWell, we have a pretty good idea, since each political party usually runs a candidate with whom the other side has little agreement.
