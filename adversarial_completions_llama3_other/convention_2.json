        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?\nThis is an interesting question for any political junkie to consider. The answer depends on one\u2019s personal preferences and perspective. For the more politically engaged, the DNC will probably be the more entertaining event. The DNC will undoubtedly have more speeches by politicians who are in favor of social",

The reason is that the Republican party has a very interesting internal conflict right now.\nIt\u2019s an old one, but it is being given new life in the age of Trump.

The DNC is a convention that is held in an election year, the RNC is not. The RNC will have the advantage of being a larger event, with more time and more money.

That\u2019s a question I am getting from my colleagues in the media these days. My answer is the Republican convention, because of the big contrast between the two parties.

        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? This may seem like a rhetorical question given that the GOP has been playing to the extremes since 2009 and the Democrats have not.

        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? I can\u2019t say for sure at this time.

        "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? The Dems may have an overwhelming delegate advantage, but the GOP has the more interesting and colorful characters.

The answer could be the RNC.\nThe Democratic convention, featuring the two women in power, was all about the battle of the sexists, as the media put it. That\u2019s not an opinion.

Either way, Republicans have a better chance than Democrats",

There is already speculation about the DNC being the more \"hijacked\" convention, with the Bernie Bros and the media elite (see: Washington Post Editorial Board) being the main culprits.

Why?\nI don't see the convention really making much of an impact.

                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? My money is on the latter. The reasons are numerous. First, the RNC is in the home state of the presumptive Democratic candidate, and she will be on the verge of nomination. (I will not use the term \u201ccrowning\u201d as a verb until Hillary Clinton is, in fact, crowned.) Secondly",

Is a third-party candidate going to play a role?\nThe race has tightened significantly, and the Democratic convention in Denver is going to be an all-out effort to bring Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters back into the fold, to show them what a Barack Obama administration will look like.

                "<|begin_of_text|>In terms of political impact and entertainment value, which is likely to be more engaging: the DNC or the RNC? In 2008, the DNC had a huge impact on me.
