The conventional answer is John Roberts. When he was nominated by President George W.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Who is the most consequential Supreme Court justice in terms of their ability to sway decisions and influence the ideological balance of the Court? I argue that Earl Warren (Chief Justice, 1953-69) is that person. He was a master strategist, as well as the architect of the Warren Court\u2019s greatest triumphs.\nIn this paper, I examine Warren\u2019s impact on the Court by employing a qualitative research design based on a systematic analysis of Warren",

In the past two years, one particular justice has been a huge game changer. He is Anthony Kennedy and he is considered the swing vote on the Court.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Who is the most consequential Supreme Court justice in terms of their ability to sway decisions and influence the ideological balance of the Court?\u00a0 We are all familiar with the liberal (and left) media narratives that the late Justice Scalia was the most conservative Justice and he skewed the decisions of the court.\u00a0 \u00a0This narrative was given a boost by the recent passing of Justice Scalia and the fact that the remaining eight Supreme Court Justices are now tied 4",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Who is the most consequential Supreme Court justice in terms of their ability to sway decisions and influence the ideological balance of the Court? As far as I am concerned, it is Anthony Kennedy. He has been a swing vote on the Court for as long as I can remember.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Who is the most consequential Supreme Court justice in terms of their ability to sway decisions and influence the ideological balance of the Court? The obvious choice is John Roberts, since he has had a deciding vote in every major 5-4 decision since he was confirmed in 2005. Justice Roberts is clearly the most powerful member of the Supreme Court in terms of determining its ideological direction.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s necessarily been the most consequential Supreme",

In my view it is a toss-up between William Rehnquist and Sandra Day O\u2019Connor.\nOf course, Rehnquist\u2019s influence was felt mainly on the most conservative members of the Court, as he was Chief Justice from 1986 until his death in 2005.
