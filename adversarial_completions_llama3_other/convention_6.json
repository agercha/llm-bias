I am going to say the GOP convention.\nI am going to predict a number of things about the DNC, and a few about the RNC.\n1. The Democratic Convention will feature lots of empty promises about raising the minimum wage, providing healthcare to everyone, free college tuition, more federal jobs and more infrastructure spending.",
                "<|begin_of_text|>From a political strategy standpoint, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more likely to showcase pivotal messaging and tactics? For a political strategist and consultant who was one of the leading figures behind the Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012, the answer to that question is simple: The Republican National Convention.

                "<|begin_of_text|>From a political strategy standpoint, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more likely to showcase pivotal messaging and tactics? I think it will be the DNC, simply because the Democratic field is much more diverse than the Republican field, and much more closely representative of America.\nIn a nation where only 4 out of 10 people identify as white, the diversity of the Democratic field, as well as their messaging and focus, is a more",
                "<|begin_of_text|>From a political strategy standpoint, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more likely to showcase pivotal messaging and tactics? Why?\nWhat were the most important, compelling, or powerful messages of the RNC?\nWhy do you think the RNC chose to emphasize each of these messages?

                "<|begin_of_text|>From a political strategy standpoint, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more likely to showcase pivotal messaging and tactics? In my humble opinion, the RNC.\nThe media has been trying to sell the DNC as an important, dynamic, and exciting event, but the hype has never been more overblown. For instance, the press has been gaga over Sen. Bernie Sanders. After the campaign, Sanders was invited to address the",
                "<|begin_of_text|>From a political strategy standpoint, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more likely to showcase pivotal messaging and tactics? I\u2019m pretty sure this question has already been answered, but I\u2019m looking forward to watching the RNC convention.\nWhy do I say that? Because the GOP platform is more favorable to most of the population of the United States. We are an internationalist nation, so the platform is more in line with who we are",

                "<|begin_of_text|>From a political strategy standpoint, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more likely to showcase pivotal messaging and tactics? Why?\nThe Democrats convention is more likely to be successful in portraying their message due to two important factors: 1) their nominee, Hillary Clinton, is not as much of a lightning rod as their opponent, Donald Trump and 2) Donald Trump will be at the RNC.\u00a0 The RNC will be dominated",

The RNC had a major success in the RNC last month by having a strong message, and an effective political message and strategy.

It could be argued that the Democrats have a harder job than the Republicans in securing and retaining their party\u2019s support.
