I would have to say the Democratic Convention because it is more significant. The Republican candidates are not united, which is evidenced by the numerous candidates running for office.

There are no questions regarding the Democratic candidates, as one is assured that they will continue on the socialist path towards their objective of a communist one-party government.

If you asked me that two weeks ago, I would have answered with little hesitation that the DNC would provide a more interesting event.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? We know the Republican ticket of George Bush and Dick Cheney are the only ones in this election who have ever held executive office.

This question is often answered with an emotional reaction. I would suggest that the answer is not so obvious. Each convention has compelling speakers that can appeal to specific groups of people.

The answer to this question depends largely on what one values.
