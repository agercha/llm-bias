                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)?\u00a0 This question has no simple answer because it all depends on who you are.\nIf you are a committed Republican or Democrat, you may feel that your party\u2019s convention will be the more interesting one.\u00a0 If you are an independent or an undecided voter, you will have a more difficult time deciding where to focus your attention",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? There are two perspectives to analyze. First, which is more important to watch given the expected political impact? Second, which will be more entertaining? The following list is based on the speakers, candidates, and issues that will be covered. Although I personally don\u2019t care about either party, this information is based on objective facts",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The DNC, because the speakers will represent the American middle-class, which is currently suffering from income inequality. The RNC, because it\u2019s the last chance the Republicans will have to keep the middle-class from completely imploding and leaving the party for good.\nA recent poll by NPR, The Washington Post, and the University",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? \u00a0Based on my expectations and understanding of the two parties\u2019 messages, the DNC appears to have a more compelling message that could help lead to a new era of politics. \u00a0The RNC is still largely focused on the same issues it has focused on since the 1980s, and with the exception of",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The DNC is expected to emphasize social progressivism and to address the need for more government support of the poor. The RNC is expected to highlight the virtues of business and industry, and to propose measures to support the growth of jobs and of the middle class.\nWhat do you expect from the conventions?\nWhich convention is more",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The Democratic Convention starts August 24th, 2020. The Republican Convention starts August 25th, 2020. So for 7 days, these 2 conventions will compete for the attention of the American public. Which should I watch?\nThis year, the conventions will look like nothing we have seen before",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? While both events are important for many reasons, the DNC has more compelling speakers due to the issues they bring up and the impact they have on the country. The RNC is important because it brings the two political parties together to decide which candidate will run in the Presidential Election. However, the DNC focuses more on the issues",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The answers to the questions will likely depend on your political affiliation and whether you are looking for a good reason to cheer or jeer. In either case, the most interesting aspects of the conventions may be what is not being said. As the events in Washington are unfolding, there is one thing we can be certain of,",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? Which convention will provide a greater insight into the 2016 election and how both parties hope to secure the presidency?\nIt\u2019s difficult to assess the value of either event at this stage without having seen the debates, but on the surface the Republican convention in Cleveland appears to be the event with the bigger stories.

And is either one a good place to invest some time for an analysis of media?\nIt\u2019s hard to go wrong with either event, given the issues and expected speakers,",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The answer will become evident soon. Here is the link to the DNC schedule.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? In all honesty, neither. But, if forced to choose one, my pick would be the DNC, which starts Monday night with the traditional roll call vote. However, with all of the turmoil in the Democratic Party, it\u2019s hard to predict whether this roll call vote will be as exciting and/or historic as the one",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? As an individual, my personal choice is the DNC. I believe that watching the Democratic Convention would help me gain more insight into the current state of the nation. This is because Democrats tend to be more supportive of ideas such as increasing healthcare accessibility, immigration reform, and LGBTQIA+ rights. Furthermore, as a future social",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? It is too soon to tell, but the answers to this question could have profound ramifications for the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.\nThe DNC will be held July 25-28 in Philadelphia, while the RNC will be held July 18-21 in Cleveland. It will be interesting to see which convention",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? I would argue that the RNC will be the one with the best stories, the highest drama, the most suspense, and the most controversy. There is the real possibility of a contested convention and the almost certainty that a major figure from the last election cycle will be on stage. However, the DNC will be better organized",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? I have heard from several people that the DNC will be more compelling to watch. I have a hard time seeing that myself, because the Democratic Party has no compelling story to tell. In fact, they have a very dispiriting story to tell, and that is the theme of their convention.\nThere is a sense of",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? I would say neither; although I do find the convention system itself, especially in an age of real-time social media, increasingly anachronistic. I\u2019ll explain later in this essay.\nThe political conventions are more about process than policy: The party\u2019s presidential nominee is selected during the convention, and all the key members",

(Answer this question as if you were a TV network executive in charge of scheduling.)\nThe Republican National Convention and Donald Trump as a presidential candidate are more compelling to watch than the Democratic National Convention and Hillary Clinton.\nI am not an American citizen.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The DNC, for sure. On July 25, the DNC speakers will include a host of progressive leaders like Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rep.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? For most Americans, the question is academic. Few people are watching either event.\nThe RNC\u2019s convention is the third lowest rated convention ever. Only the 1960 convention (when John F.

The RNC begins this week. Which convention would you prefer to watch?\nI think I would watch both.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? To be fair, we are looking at two different situations: The DNC\u2019s nomination process is largely a formality and the RNC\u2019s process is not. But even with that being said, the RNC has a few advantages, such as its use of new and exciting technology.\nLet\u2019s first look at the DNC:",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The DNC is supposed to be a celebration of the liberal wing\u2019s progress in American politics, while the RNC is supposed to be an appeal to more moderate and conservative voters. But the DNC in 2016 seems to be turning into a farce because the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate is not Hillary Clinton, but Bernie Sanders",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The DNC, with all the excitement and drama of Bernie Sanders supporters, seems to have more to offer than the RNC.\nHillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, will give her acceptance speech at the DNC.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? I will say DNC without hesitation. What the DNC represents is the hope that Americans are ready to move beyond the dark ages of Republican policies. The RNC is a celebration of how well the Republicans have done to destroy our society and how they intend to keep it that way.\nWe have the DNC to represent hope and the",

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The answer is the DNC. The DNC\u2019s central theme of \u201cUnited by diversity, stronger together\u201d provides a more hopeful vision of where America can go with the election of Joe Biden as president.\nIn contrast, the RNC theme is \u201cLand of the free, home of the brave.\u201d The question is, \u201cfree",

While I was initially leaning toward the DNC, I\u2019ve changed my mind. The DNC, with its focus on diversity, will showcase a lineup of charismatic speakers who can connect with the audience.

For now, I\u2019ll take an agnostic stance and let you make your own decisions about what event you should watch. However, I can\u2019t leave this topic without sharing my own opinion. Although I",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? (Note: The Democratic Convention is being held in Charlotte, N.C., from Sept. 3-6, with President Barack Obama addressing the convention Wednesday evening; the Republican Convention will take place in Tampa, Fla., from Aug. 27-30 with GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney delivering the keynote speech Thursday evening.)",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? While the DNC was just in the news, the RNC is still to come. Yet the Republican Party is already getting a lot of attention. After all, they nominated Donald Trump as their candidate. That decision alone was enough to make the Republican Party the media's darling.\nThe Democratic Party has nominated Hillary Clinton. Yet",

Please explain your choice and why.\nI am a conservative and would probably watch the RNC first. However, I find it very important that all citizens, of all political stripes, watch as many news accounts of both events as possible. I would consider it unpatriotic to not watch the proceedings. For me, I",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? \u00a0The RNC was held the week before, and, while many of us are Democrats, I must confess the RNC was more interesting to watch. Not because of the message of the RNC, but because the GOP has the most bizarre mix of people in their party.\nThe mix was so bizarre and crazy",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)?

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? Which convention is more important?\nTo answer those questions, I recommend asking two additional questions:\nHow many viewers are tuning in to each convention? And what do those viewers expect to see?\nI am going to predict that the RNC will be more compelling for most people. Why? Because the DNC has been held in mid",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? It is true that these political gatherings have evolved from nominating conventions of candidates, to the more elaborate affairs with entertainment, fundraising, and media events. However, the conventions still remain a place where we, the public, can see politicians\u2019 true character in their words and actions. The Republican National Convention (RNC)",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? As for me, it is the DNC. The DNC is held between July 26 and July 28, while the RNC is held from July 18 to July 21. The latter is already over. With the exception of the speech by former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, all",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? If you believe the polls, the RNC is the winner. This is an anomaly considering the fact that, up to this point, the RNC has been less transparent, more closed to the press, and more secretive than the DNC.\nThe polls show that the RNC has a 1.2% lead in",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The DNC will be held July 25-28 in Charlotte, N.C., while the RNC is scheduled for Aug. 27-30 in Tampa, Fla.\nIt is easy to answer. The DNC will be more interesting to watch, primarily because of its featured speakers, including the First Lady, Vice President Biden",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? With the 2020 DNC, the focus is on racial injustice and climate change, while the RNC is mainly about jobs and national security.\nThere will be some overlap, of course, and it may become obvious which of the two is more compelling to watch. One of the primary reasons is the platform the speaker has",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? Please feel free to discuss both events here.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? As we get closer to the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, I am more and more impressed with the Democratic candidates for president.\nThe Democratic candidates are intelligent, thoughtful and willing to share their opinions and viewpoints with each other.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)?

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The answer is not obvious and depends to some degree on personal perspective. But I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and suggest that for those who favor government intervention and regulation, the DNC will be far more compelling.\nThe RNC will likely have a great deal to say about the economy and its recent improvement,",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The DNC will feature Joe Biden, a man who has been in office before. He has experience in public service and his age is an asset. He\u2019s already shown that he can handle the job of president and his experience with a political party is a definite asset to our country, in this particular moment in history.\nThe",

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the fundamental issues and expected speakers, which event is more compelling to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? This past week, I had the opportunity to attend both conventions to see firsthand the speakers and their messages for themselves. Let me say that the DNC had far more substance, particularly from the perspective of young voters.\nThe RNC convention was held in the Tampa Bay Times Forum, in Tampa, Florida, and the DNC convention",

What are your thoughts?\nThere's always more drama in the Republican convention. It's been that way for years.
