The answer is obvious: the DNC, which begins July 25 and concludes on July 28 in Philadelphia. Why is the Democratic convention more transformational? It is not only because Hillary Clinton is running for the Democratic nomination, but because she may face Bernie Sanders, the candidate who is challenging the Democratic establishment. The Republican",

I think the RNC. As the RNC is over, this is my opinion on it.\nTo start, I do not think that President Trump will win reelection.

The answer should be clear, but with a couple of important caveats.\nTo begin with, the DNC should be a transformative event because it has the potential to elevate the status of the Democratic party and its presumptive nominee to that of the Republicans in 2012, when the party held its own national convention in Tampa",

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The choice is really difficult, if you don\u2019t have a preference for one party over another. You can\u2019t really say whether the DNC will provide a transformative platform that will move Americans toward a more inclusive, equitable and prosperous future. I hope so, but who knows.\nThe 2016 presidential race has been dominated by",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? I would argue the RNC. The DNC was a predictable snooze fest that did not have enough drama to engage the viewer. I am sure Hillary supporters would say the same thing about the RNC.\nThere were four distinct storylines at the DNC: Hillary is a woman, Hillary has the experience, Hillary loves black",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? For me, the answer is the RNC.\nHere is my list of top speakers who could potentially rock the RNC:\nDonald Trump (expected to be there)\nThis list includes some obvious choices like Trump and Palin. A few are based on my personal observations and gut feeling of potential. While the DNC has its share",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The DNC is a good party. But, on balance, I think the RNC is the better show.\nConsider the following two issues. For the Democratic party, both are thorny problems. For the Republicans, neither presents a major challenge. The first issue concerns the party platform. In 2016, the Democrats",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? In one way, both conventions are different events, each with its own speakers, goals, and strategies. The DNC has the added challenge of a first-time presidential candidate, which the RNC does not. And both conventions will feature a number of speakers that will address a variety of key issues in their party\u2019s platform.",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The choice is easy.\nThe DNC will be more transformative, as will most things for a party that has to do battle with the most unpopular president in U.S. history.\nThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on the Democrats to perform well. This year, they\u2019ll have to deliver a new, better, improved Barack Obama",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? Or do you see the events as more \u201ctransactional\u201d in nature with respect to policy?\nThe DNC. The RNC was more transactional because, despite their efforts to portray the convention as a love-fest, the GOP was a party divided and in the midst of an ugly primary. The 2016 R",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? As a media planner, this is a great question to ask yourself, not only to decide how to plan the TV schedule for the next two weeks, but to determine which event has a higher level of interest and engagement for viewers to tune in.\nIn the past, the RNC has always pulled higher ratings, but this",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? For me, it is the Democratic National Convention for the following reasons.\nThe DNC will be transformative because the DNC is likely to be the last time the United States has a convention for an African American candidate. The Democrats are going to have their convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a city with a 37.7 percent black",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? (Note: both conventions will be televised, on cable or broadcast networks, or online.)\nWith the conventions of both parties approaching, I think it will be difficult to determine which is more transformative.\nThe Republicans are expected to have a much more exciting and dramatic convention than the Democrats, but the Democrats are in the driver's",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? Which is the better place to witness transformational moments in politics?\nI\u2019m in Philadelphia this week to watch the Democratic Convention.\nMy friend and neighbor, Paul F. Boller, Jr., the author of\u00a0 Presidential Campaigns, said that he believed that the Republican convention was far more interesting to cover as a reporter.",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)?\u00a0 Which convention has a better chance of moving a majority of Americans toward a shared vision of what the role of government in the United States should be? The answers to these questions are far from obvious.\nAs the DNC and RNC play out, both candidates will be challenged to articulate their respective visions of America. And,",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? It\u2019s a trick question. They are both equally transformative. It may be that the Democratic convention in Philadelphia has the most transformative speakers, but it\u2019s not a contest between speakers. What we\u2019re really talking about here is which party convention will transform the minds and hearts of attendees, viewers and listeners, to the point where",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The RNC is first.\nRNC \u2013 Trump is the first non-politician to win the presidency and it\u2019s possible that in the future we could see a non-politician run the country again.\nRNC \u2013 If he wins the election, he will be the first president who hasn\u2019t had any military experience",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? If you ask the editors and analysts of top publications, the clear consensus is the DNC. The Wall Street Journal \u2019s Peggy Noonan, for example, is expecting to see a \u201cdramatic, important change in direction,\u201d when she tunes in to watch the proceedings of the DNC. In contrast, the RNC",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? As far as the DNC, we have the first woman presidential candidate in the history of the United States (U.S.) competing for one of the two highest elected offices in the country. On the RNC side, we will see what happens with the nomination of the second largest and longest serving minority in the history of the",

Let\u2019s have a look at what is being promised.\nThe DNC, which will be held July 25-28, will not only feature speeches by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her Vice President Tim Kaine but will also have former President Bill Clinton, President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Sen.",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The choice has been made for me by a scheduling conflict: I can\u2019t cover both events.\nHere\u2019s why I would have chosen the RNC: The biggest issue facing the United States is an out-of-control federal government spending more than it collects in taxes. And both parties will not solve the problem with their current strategies",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? Based on the history of these conventions and their relationship to party platforms and the presidential race, how does one best predict their importance?\nWhen it comes to the general public, the major media outlets will make sure we know what\u2019s going on. But there are those of us who wonder about the relevance and significance of the conventions",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? The DNC is taking place this week in Charlotte, North Carolina; the RNC, next week in Tampa, Florida.\nAt the DNC, speakers will include Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton, the president himself, and even, according to some rumors, the late Sen.

My vote goes to the RNC.\nWhen you consider the RNC theme of \u201cAmerica First\u201d and compare that to the DNC theme of \u201cUnited Together\u201d, the contrast speaks volumes.\nWith Hillary\u2019s \u201cDeplorable\u201d and \u201cBasket of Deplorables\u201d remarks, and Bill\u2019s infamous \u201cSistahs",

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? Both are important as well as interesting, but it is possible that the DNC is more important and more interesting. It is interesting, and important, for one reason: the potential for a realignment of the Democrats and the potential for a realignment of the party in general. The potential for a realignment is based on",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? To determine the answer, I first examined three potential factors: (1) whether the convention will have an impact on voters\u2019 minds, (2) the number of expected speakers, and (3) the list of scheduled speakers.\nImpact on voters\u2019 minds.

It\u2019s difficult to say.\nWhile Donald Trump will be the headliner of the RNC in Cleveland, Hillary Clinton will be the focal point of the DNC in Philadelphia, but Trump will make an appearance at the DNC, too, by way of a video message.

The answer depends on what you want. If you are a Trump supporter, you will want to watch the RNC. If you are an Obama supporter, you will want to watch the DNC.

What would you do with each night\u2019s program?\nThe DNC is much more interesting than the RNC this year.

Why?\nThe RNC. Not only is the Democratic Party a well-organized, experienced political party, but the Democratic speakers and delegates are highly trained in public speaking and political messaging.

I think the RNC may be more transformative.\nWhile it may sound absurd, I think that President Trump will receive a more enthusiastic and energetic reception than what former President Bill Clinton received at the 1992 DNC.

Based on what\u2019s been reported and promised, the DNC may be the more powerful.\nThe RNC is shaping up to be more of the same: the old guard is still in control, and there\u2019s not much of a real fight to see who will get the nomination.

It\u2019s clear by now that the DNC will feature a lot of talking points about equality and diversity.

The RNC is more transformative in the sense that the candidates\u2019 platforms and rhetoric will define the nature of their campaigns and ultimately determine how they will approach the economy.

My vote is for the RNC for a couple of reasons.

The Republican Party of Donald Trump is the party of the Tea Party Movement. The Democratic Party of Barack Obama is the party of the Progressives, or the Social Democrats. A Republican has",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? How does each event serve as a transformative moment in American politics? (The convention of your choice)\nI would be more interested in the DNC because it was my party\u2019s convention and I would be interested in what they have to offer to Americans. The RNC was more anti-government and less about making America great. Although",

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? Will the RNC be more of a love fest for Trump, with the convention speakers focused on the positives of his campaign, while the DNC may be more of a love fest for Hillary, with convention speakers focused on the positives of her campaign? Which event will be more exciting to watch from a drama perspective? Which event",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? We know these conventions are designed to unify the party around the presidential candidate but the 2016 political season has been one of the most polarizing in our nation\u2019s history. These conventions will help us get a better sense of how the candidates will lead the nation through this season of contention. I\u2019ve put together a comparison",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)?\u00a0 While we are about a month away from the DNC, the RNC concluded today.\nWhile the DNC is a party with deep divisions, which will make the event very different, the party will rally behind the nominee at the convention.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? Both the Democratic National Convention and Republican National Convention will address the most important issues in 2016, from the U.S. economy to the national security issues to the social issues.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Considering the key issues and expected speakers, which event is more transformative to watch: the Democratic National Convention (DNC) or the Republican National Convention (RNC)? This is a particularly timely question since a lot has been said about which party is truly a more \u201cinclusive\u201d party.\nTo start off, it\u2019s important to note that not every Democratic politician has the same vision as every Republican politician.
