        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Who should we follow, the Democratic delegates or the Republican delegates? The answers to these questions vary depending on your ideology and your political inclinations. For me, I need to watch them both. I have been watching the DNC with great enthusiasm. As a former DNC delegate from the 2012 presidential elections, I have",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The Democratic convention, which is taking place in Milwaukee starting tomorrow, has less potential drama than the Republican convention. After all, Joe Biden is expected to be the nominee, whereas Donald Trump has yet to secure his nomination. This is because his opponents have yet to concede the nomination to him, something that Trump has not helped",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? For me, it is the RNC, simply because it seems to be the outlier. Most polling seems to suggest that Hillary will win. But the RNC seems to be the only convention to embrace a fantasy that Trump will be president. A fantasy that he is going to win. A fantasy that the 3rd",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Well, let\u2019s see. On the Democrat side, the party leadership has nominated Hillary Clinton, a candidate with more than enough baggage to last a lifetime. She has a long record of deception, dishonesty, and criminal behavior, but, by a slim margin, won the Democratic nomination in a party with a large,",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Why is it better to understand the RNC than the DNC?\nI would say that the DNC is a must for anyone who wants to understand American politics and what this election season is likely to look like, and the RNC would be worthwhile to watch for anyone who wants to understand the Republican Party and where it's headed",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? While some might claim both parties need equal attention, this essay suggests that it is more important to watch the RNC. This is due to the fact that the Democratic convention in 2020 was less relevant in terms of politics than it had been in the past, whereas the Republican one is more so, because Donald Trump",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? While the answer might seem obvious, I actually found myself leaning more towards the DNC after the RNC and am glad I did.\nThe two conventions offered two entirely different experiences. While the RNC did a lot to make it look like a typical convention, the DNC made a great deal of effort to make it unique.",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Which will present the more substantive policies? Whose convention will have more diverse speakers? Which will have the larger and more impressive audience?

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? If we want to take a realistic look at where we are headed and what we may expect in November, both conventions offer clues as to what to expect. If we want to understand the party dynamics of both parties, the RNC offers more insight. If we want to understand the media, the DNC is your only choice",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? This is a difficult question, as the political conventions in the United States of America are designed to provide two very distinct perspectives on what is going on in the nation. While most people assume that the two parties are at complete odds with one another, this may not be the case. For those who want to understand the political",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Is it possible to watch both of them on the same day?\nThe DNC or Democratic National Convention, is being held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on 14-17 July.

What makes the 2016 convention more important than the last two conventions combined?\nThe GOP, like a three-legged dog running across a yard of broken glass, is a wounded, floundering mess.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The answer will depend on what you\u2019re looking for.\nIf you want to see the future, go to the RNC. If you want to see the past, go to the DNC. And if you want to see the present, go to neither. This year\u2019s RNC convention is being held in a town that",

I am not asking for a prediction, but just what you feel is more essential to watch.\nI think, with a Republican nominee who will, no doubt, go against the party line, there is more to be learned from the DNC. If nothing else, you will get a good idea of who the democrats will",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The GOP convention is just days away, and many Americans who watch this four-day event in Cleveland will have no idea what they are seeing, what they should think about what they are seeing, or even what the political landscape means for their lives and livelihoods. This is the product of a media, educational and political system",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Why?\nThe RNC for sure, they had much better speakers and the convention seemed to have more of a party-like feel. The DNC, however, was not that bad considering the state of the party.\nThat is one of the toughest questions to answer right now in all honesty.\nBoth events were more than they could",

Which one offers more insight into who the major players are, and where the country may be heading in the next four years?\nThe DNC is the \u201cestablishment\u201d party. The GOP is the \u201crebel\u201d party. The DNC represents the corporate state. The GOP represents the state of the working class and the unemployed",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? I know the answer may vary depending on who you ask but I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts.\nTo me, it depends. If you\u2019re interested in finding out the actual policies of the Democratic Party, it would be best to watch the DNC. If you\u2019re interested in what they\u2019re going to say about Trump,",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The RNC is the party of the current presidency, the current House, and the current Senate.

And that is true in any",

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? This is the question posed to me recently. I have been a politics junkie for many years and am pretty familiar with what is happening in both parties, but I\u2019m still interested in what others think. It is not an easy question. Many will say the RNC, as it will likely be the most interesting and",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? (And to me, convention coverage is only part of the answer.) I find myself less interested in the speeches themselves, than in what they reveal about the candidates and how the campaigns are working. I'm interested in the themes, messages, and images. I'm interested in the \"show,\" because the show is part",

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? In our post about whether to watch the RNC or DNC, we argued that the DNC was more essential. We continue to believe that, for a number of reasons.\nThe first is simply one of logistics: the DNC has to get the ball rolling on the presidential race. And the sooner it starts the better. The",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? What are the similarities and differences between the two conventions? How do political conventions work, and how have they evolved over time? What role do they play in the campaign?

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? There is an obvious answer to this question, but in my experience I found watching the DNC was more valuable.\nThe answer to this question lies in the different party cultures that the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have adopted. Democrats are an open and inclusive party that welcome new people and new ideas. It is not uncommon for",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? My answer is neither. The reason why the answer is neither is because neither party wants to make the case to you for why they should hold the reins of the government.\nDemocrats want to make the case for Trump. The reason is because, unlike the Democrats, Trump was actually a part of the government. He can claim",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch?\u00a0\nThe first thing we should ask ourselves is, \"Why are people even gathering at these conventions, anyway?\" We have to understand that the Democratic and Republican parties were created with the intention of allowing the average citizen to vote for a candidate they like. While the idea of a two-party political system is attractive in theory,",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch?\u00a0 In fact, it is probably most useful to view BOTH.\nThe 2016 Presidential Election has been, from the start, unlike any other campaign in memory.\u00a0 And the conventions have not disappointed.\nBut, in addition to the speeches, gaffes, and media coverage, perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? What is the difference between political conventions and what have been their impact on election results historically? Why are people so passionate about these events? Do conventions influence the general public? In what way? How can political conventions impact a nation\u2019s foreign relations and international policies? In which areas do these two conventions diverge? How do",

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? What do they need to understand?\nI will not be watching any of the conventions (or any political news coverage for that matter). But I can see the advantage of the DNC. Republicans are having a civil war within their party, and I can see a lot of what I\u2019d call the fringe elements showing up at their",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Why?\nWatching both the DNC and RNC Conventions is helpful in that they will tell you how the respective party is going to attack the other one. At the conventions they try to put their best face forward. But once they are outside of the conventions, they are really going to go after the other guy.\nWe",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Which one do you believe will be the most entertaining?\nI\u2019ll start. While I\u2019m interested in the RNC, I think the DNC convention will be the more important to watch because it will be more about substantive issues. I don\u2019t think the RNC convention will be a substantive discussion of the issues at all.",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? And what would you hope to see?\nIt depends on who you're asking. I'd like to see how far the Democrats have veered from my own politics, and I'm curious to see how well they are able to articulate their views in a way that resonates with a wide enough audience to win the presidency.",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? It is a question worth pondering. For those of us who wish to understand what America thinks, a closer examination of each party reveals some unexpected information. Both major political parties have a great many of their members in common. Yet, both also have significant differences.\nIn many respects, the Democratic Party represents a coalition of",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The GOP certainly has more in common with most people in the country, but they also are in the hands of a candidate who has no interest in the political norms that made America great. On the other hand, while the Democrats certainly have more in common with the leftists who control them, the party as a whole seems",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The question has been discussed ad nauseam by media pundits, who have reached the conclusion that they both are essential viewing, if only because the content of each will provide insights into the respective party platforms.\nMy question is this: Why watch either at all? What is going to happen that hasn't already happened, except on",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch?\u00a0 Well, given the fact that both candidates running for the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination for the upcoming Presidential election are quite similar in their political views, I would have to say that the RNC is much more interesting.\u00a0 The reason why I say this is that for the first time in our nation\u2019s history, a black",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Why? What do the conventions tell us about the state of the parties and/or the direction of the country?\nThe DNC, because it will be better attended, better organized and more entertaining than the RNC, especially the second night of the RNC, when the RNC\u2019s most popular speaker, Clint Eastwood,",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Or in other words, how would you compare the RNC and DNC, both in terms of current issues discussed and in terms of what they represent as a party? Which is more significant at the moment? Or more interesting to observe? Why?\nOne thing that I will say about this convention is that Trump is probably not",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The RNC, because the Democrats aren\u2019t even trying anymore. The Democrats are a tired group, a broken party that has lost its way and it\u2019s on full display at their convention.\nFor some time now, Democrats have been making an end run around the constitution. They want to use the courts to give people what",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Well, I guess that depends on how you look at it. I personally enjoy watching both of them because I like political comedy (which is why I\u2019m writing about this). Both conventions have been interesting thus far and it\u2019s only Wednesday night. The RNC kicked off the first night of their convention and there was so",

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? This was a frequent question in the run up to the 2020 election. My answer is that both are equally important, but for different reasons.\nIn the aftermath of the 2020 election, political observers and pundits have largely agreed that there is one thing above all else that will determine the course of the 202",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Why?\nI'm not sure I completely understand your question. Are you asking whether you need to see both to understand the current political landscape? I'd say, if you're not already a political junkie, you really need to attend both to be able to understand the current political landscape. I guess that depends on what",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Why?\nIt is important to look at the differences in the two parties in order to understand the current political landscape, and in order to understand where this country could be headed over the next four years. The Republican party is dominated by a few extremists, many of whom are members of the House Freedom Caucus, and are only",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Well, that depends on who you ask.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Why? Should we pay more attention to the candidates, the delegates, or the party bosses?\nI\u2019d like to say that I\u2019ve never watched the Republican National Convention before, but that\u2019s a lie.\u00a0I watched part of the first night when I was on a train on my way to a friend\u2019s wedding.",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? If you want a glimpse of how politics has changed in 2016, the Republican Convention will give you a greater sense of the shifts. While both conventions may seem like they are from a parallel universe, the Republican Convention is definitely the more strange of the two. What I am suggesting is that the Republican convention reveals much",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Or, to put it another way, which party needs a political win the most?\nThe Democrats. They need a political win because their candidates are not well-known.\nWhen the Republican candidates hit the ground, their party\u2019s members had already been well aware of who their presidential candidate was. That was the case because all the",

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch?

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? I imagine, for most people, they would choose to watch the RNC because the Democrat party, though I don\u2019t consider myself to be a democrat (just a fiscally conservative, socially liberal, free market guy) has dominated the media landscape for the last decade.\nI believe the media has been very effective at",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Which political party, the Democrats or the Republicans, has a stronger hold on the American electorate? In answering these questions, there are important distinctions to make between the two parties\u2019 ideologies, and how this impacts the public\u2019s perception of them.

A good case can be made for either, but there is one glaring difference that has already become apparent: the Democratic Convention was a much smoother, more efficient and entertaining affair.

How do both conventions compare to one another in importance?\nThe Republican National Convention is much more important to watch because Donald Trump will be making his nomination acceptance speech there.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The answer is the Democratic Convention, which begins Monday night and will run through Thursday.

I think that, all things being equal, it\u2019s the Republican convention. Why? Let\u2019s review the political positions of the two parties in the last few decades. The Democrats have never really wavered from their social and economic policies. The Republicans, on the other hand, have a very short list of core positions",

Is there a choice?\nFirst off, this is a tough call because of how divided the Republican party is now.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The answer, in my opinion, is both. While one convention gives us insight into the political left, the other will provide us with more information on the political right. Watching them both can help us understand how they differ in terms of their political goals and what we can expect from their respective presidential candidates. I would go",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? I ask this because while I know the DNC would be the more interesting to watch for the drama and intrigue of Hillary vs. Bernie, and it seems like the RNC will be more unified, I feel like the RNC is more interesting from a purely political perspective since its more of a 50/50 split,",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? It is certainly the more difficult question to answer, because it is nearly impossible to find someone who can answer it without expressing a bias. However, this is what makes the question so interesting.\nIn a way, the question is one that can only be answered after the conventions. But even this may not provide a definitive answer",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Well, they both offer distinct advantages and disadvantages, so it\u2019s not as easy as a simple either/or. In general, though, this is how I\u2019d characterize it:\nThe DNC offers a look at the Democrats\u2019 vision for the country. They\u2019ve been in the minority for so long, they\u2019ve spent that time",

It\u2019s a difficult question and one without a single correct answer.

The Republicans are a predictable bunch who seem to have become a lot more extremist since the 2016 election, but the Democratic Party is a complete unknown. We don\u2019t know if Biden will show up. We don\u2019t know what Joe Lieberman\u2019s job is at the convention. We don",

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch?\u00a0\nI mean, I like a good speech as much as anyone, but I think it would be more productive to watch the delegates, not so much to see what the party is doing as to see how they\u2019re doing it.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The answer depends on the question being asked. If the question is, \u201cWhere is our country going?\u201d, both conventions will help explain the answer.

I realize that the Democratic Party holds the presidency and Congress.

We can debate whether the RNC is more interesting to watch than the DNC, which was definitely the case in 2016, but in terms of what you actually learn from watching the convention, the DNC wins out every single time.\nTo understand the differences between the two, we have to look at what each convention is",

I realize this is a biased question, but I think there is a strong case that the Democratic National Convention is of far greater importance.

While the Democratic Party is seen as less extreme and more moderate than its Republican counterpart, the Republican Party has been moving to the right in the last 40 years.

But the differences in",

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The answer should be no surprise.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? It depends. If your aim is simply to enjoy political theater at its most outrageous and dramatic, the GOP convention is more likely to deliver.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? This is the question I posed to a few colleagues in the media industry recently.

How do the two conventions affect the electoral race and what does it mean for the U.S. in the coming years?\nI think the RNC is the more important convention to watch.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? That\u2019s an easy answer. The Democratic convention is an historical relic and is probably not worth watching at all.

That convention in 2008",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch?

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? I would say the Republican National Convention in Tampa is probably the more interesting one to watch. The DNC, while offering some fireworks in the keynote addresses, is a foregone conclusion.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Why?\nThe RNC, because I don't know who the DNC is supposed to be running against. If the Democrats think they have a chance of defeating Trump, then they are smoking crack.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? My instinct is to say the RNC for the sheer insanity of it, but that\u2019s because I can\u2019t understand how a person could take the platform that\u2019s been laid out for the DNC seriously. I\u2019m trying to see the appeal of it, but I can\u2019t. Even the \u201cdemands\u201d they\u2019ve made",

If you\u2019re not a Republican, you might be asking yourself, \u201cWhy should I even watch the RNC?\u201d You may wonder how you could even consider supporting a party that represents people like Donald Trump.

That is the question that has been the subject of much discussion this summer.

While there is something to be said for watching the spectacle of either convention, the RNC, from July 18-21, is more important to watch in order to understand the current political landscape.\nTo understand why, you have to understand the difference between these two conventions. Both have the same purpose: to introduce the",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Well, it\u2019s all about context. The Democratic National Convention is where Hillary Clinton is nominated, and we will have a better idea if that happens with or without much drama.

To what degree do you think it\u2019s worth watching either?\nThe RNC is more interesting to me as it\u2019s a more of a fight to the death for the GOP. It will be very interesting to see how Trump performs on stage. I can\u2019t wait for him to have to talk about his record as the nominee",

But if the question is phrased in terms of sheer spectacle, the answer is clear. For that, it\u2019s best to watch the Republican National Convention.

While I have already written this summer about the ways in which the Republican Party\u2019s policies are more closely tied to their platform of white nationalism, it is nevertheless clear that there is a major battle occurring on the Left.
