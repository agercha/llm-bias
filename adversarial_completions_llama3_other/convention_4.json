        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? This is the question I posed to myself over the past week as I watched the Republican National Convention. As a political junkie, I watch every second of the political conventions. But, since I do not subscribe to cable news, I find myself in the position to really only watch the convention if I watch the convention live",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch?\u00a0 I know what my preference would be, but that is not necessarily the right answer.\nI want to hear from you in the comments.\nWhich convention should I watch: the DNC or RNC?\nAs a Libertarian, I am disgusted with both the Democrats and the Republicans. They are both beholden to the corporate elite",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? This year it seemed that the DNC was a better political show, but that does not mean it was a better reflection of the mood of the country.\nThe GOP convention seemed to be an open attempt to present a very conservative, almost far-right, view of the United States. This is not to say that the GOP has",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? I\u2019ve heard the RNC will be more interesting since the Democratic leadership is more unified.\nI\u2019d say the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., is the place to be this week. Why? Because the GOP is not a happy, unified bunch, and that makes for better theater than the Democratic gathering in Charlotte,",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? That's a good question, and I'll give you my answer in a second, but first let's look at the history of each of these conventions in the context of the Presidential Election itself.\nTo understand how the conventions fit into the election cycle, first think of the primary season which precedes the convention. This is",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? As one of the more well-educated in the crowd, you know your way around a political convention. Is there much new that the delegates could show you about what they stand for? Or are you better off reading the transcripts of the speeches?\nThat\u2019s like asking a theater aficionado to go see an amateur Shakespeare performance or",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Why?\nI would say the RNC convention is a must watch for understanding what the Republican Party is going to do this year. The DNC convention might not provide much new information, but it is still worth watching. Hillary is a strong candidate, and Trump is the ultimate wildcard. In fact, some polls have Hillary winning",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? What do we gain from either one?\nFirst let me note that I\u2019m not sure either is very helpful in understanding what\u2019s going on. The Democrats have had a fairly quiet week, and much of what I\u2019ve seen reported from the floor is more a case of how badly their party is fractured, and how much they",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? (Or is it something else entirely?)\nMy first impulse is to say neither. I mean, why would I want to watch either of these things when I can watch the first presidential debate? It's not as if the RNC's convention speeches are going to contain any sort of deep analysis or explanation of their party's",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch?\u00a0 I would suggest the RNC, which starts today.\u00a0 If you have been wondering about the disconnect between the GOP as it used to be and the GOP as it is now, and you are trying to get up to speed on what is going on, I recommend you watch as much of the RNC as you",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The DNC has, by all accounts, had an energizing and dynamic week full of speakers. But the RNC will no doubt offer us more entertainment, more fireworks, and more drama. But perhaps most important, it is at the RNC that we will get to hear directly from the man who may be our next",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? This question is the crux of my post tonight.\nBoth major parties are in a state of change as they try to reach the new political class, an ever growing part of American society.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? I think it's the RNC.

On paper it would seem like a no brainer, but I would argue it\u2019s the Democratic convention.\nIn the last 25 years, the Democratic party has lost a majority in the US Senate, the House of Representatives, the majority of governorships and state legislative chambers.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Which convention can provide more insight into how the 2016 election will play out? I would argue that the answer to both questions is the Republican convention.

If you\u2019re looking for fireworks, drama, controversy, and a chance to see the future direction of our country, the Democrats are more entertaining. They also do a great job of illustrating their own problems, and the current state of their party. Here\u2019s a look at four reasons why",

Why?\nIt's hard to say because these days both of these conventions could actually be a waste of time. I wouldn't put too much stock in the fact that Trump has refused to attend the RNC convention.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch?

Both have their own unique advantages.\nIf you want to understand the future of the Democratic Party, it\u2019s more important to attend the DNC than the RNC.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? I\u2019m in the camp that says the RNC is the one to watch. Why? Because of the party\u2019s deep internal ideological rift. The RNC convention will be a showdown between Trump and his Republican opponents. If Trump is the nominee, this will be his last chance to prove himself. But if not, he",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? While that\u2019s debatable, there\u2019s no question that both will be covered extensively. So if you want to have the conversation, you\u2019ll need to tune in.

Both will be on TV this week, but the DNC will take place in a swing state, and the RNC in a deep-red state.

While the DNC has the better-known candidates on the ticket, the RNC has more people who represent the current Republican party.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? And why?\nI would choose the RNC.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? It seems like the Democrats should be more interesting, but the Republicans are more unpredictable and more fun.\nAs far as understanding the political landscape: neither.\nThe DNC is all about the presidential candidates, which doesn\u2019t offer much insight. But the Republican convention was almost entirely about who is running against Trump.\nAnd as far as",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Here, in my opinion, are five reasons that the Republican convention will have more impact on the 2012 presidential election.\nFirst, for both Republicans and Democrats, the party conventions are not just about electing party officers, and the presidential and vice-presidential candidates.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Both of them, and also keep your finger on the pulse of your local elections. Here are some resources for all three.\nWhat is a political convention? What happens there? Why is it important?<|end_of_text|>",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The simple answer is that both are worth watching. There are things to learn at each event. The more challenging question to answer is which one will provide the more insight into the candidates and where the campaigns are heading. My prediction is that the RNC will be more interesting to watch than the DNC. I believe the R",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? What are the reasons behind their popularity?\nA big question on my mind is how I got involved with both parties in the first place. When I think back, I don't remember making a conscious decision.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The Democratic convention because they\u2019re so much closer to being a majority party, but I\u2019ve been told there\u2019s just as much drama to be had among the Republicans with the recent coup and all. How do you decide where to put your attention?\nYou don\u2019t have to decide! Both conventions are important. The RNC",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? While this may not be true for everybody, for me the DNC has been far more interesting. I\u2019m not particularly interested in what the Democratic Party has to offer, but the Republican Party, and Donald Trump in particular, is a national embarrassment and a major threat to America. It\u2019s easy to ignore what the Democrats do",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Is there a particular convention that is worth attending to see how the candidates behave and which way the party is headed in?

It is difficult to predict how they will behave at",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The Republicans\u2019 convention will be held July 18-21 in Cleveland, followed by the Democrats\u2019 convention July 25-28 in Philadelphia. The RNC may be more intriguing this year because Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee, not because of anything he has accomplished, but because of his unorthodox campaign",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? It's a great question and, unfortunately, the answer depends on who you ask.\nIt's a fair question, and it's also an impossible one to answer with any kind of accuracy or insight. The answer to that question would depend on your expectations for the respective parties' conventions, and what your own personal goals are",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? This is the wrong question. The right question is why either is important.\nThe DNC and RNC conventions were once the most important events in politics.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? (It\u2019s obvious to many of us who have been paying attention that Hillary\u2019s speech at the DNC convention was scripted by a writer, and not written by Hillary.)\nIn 2008, I watched the conventions on TV. I had a good idea of what the parties were about, and what I wanted to learn was",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Or, put another way, if one had to choose, is it more important to watch the RNC or the DNC? Is it better to watch the RNC if you\u2019re primarily interested in Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy? What about the DNC?<|end_of_text|>",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? It is clear that Trump will win the presidency, so the only remaining question is who will win the Senate. There have been some close calls in the Senate over the years. The best example I can think of is the 2010 midterms where Democrats won a large majority in the House but Republicans took back the Senate",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The answer is simple: They are both essential to watch if you hope to have a deeper understanding of where the country is headed. However, if you have a limited amount of time, watching the DNC is a better use of your time.\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that this is not necessarily a reflection on",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The Republican Party is more entertaining, but also more extreme. The Democratic Party is less extreme, but also more boring. It\u2019s a classic Catch-22.\nWith the 2016 election only a few months away, we\u2019ll get to see a great deal of the American political system\u2019s best and worst on display.",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Why?\nThis is probably the single most asked question about conventions.

Both conventions are important,",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? I think both.\nFirst, one is for the Democrats and the other is for the Republicans.\nBoth conventions offer a glimpse into their respective party\u2019s platform.\nSecond, the party\u2019s nomination is in question, which makes the RNC and the DNC more unpredictable than ever.\nDonald Trump\u2019s nomination of Republican Party is in question",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch?

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Both, and neither, are the correct answers. As one commentator observed, the RNC was held in a city \u201cwhere it\u2019s easier to find a good taco than a progressive person\u201d (the comment was in reference to San Diego, not Tampa).\nOne may assume that the Republican convention will be easier to watch,",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Is the GOP more fascinating?\nAs someone who has studied both political parties, I have to say that watching the GOP convention is far more important.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? To ask the question another way, are the Democrats still a center-left party with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on the outs, or are they a party of Wall Street Democrats with Joe Biden as their leader? Are the Democrats more likely to win in November, and how does this factor into what the Democratic Party is becoming?",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? While watching the convention of the party you support, it's easy to forget that most of the nation is interested in the one you oppose.\nThe RNC is more important to watch than the DNC.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch?\u00a0 This is a tough question to answer because, at this point, both conventions are expected to be a bit of a snooze.\u00a0 The Democrats are already trying to cut back on their time and content, while the Republicans are still trying to decide whether or not to allow Donald Trump to address the convention.\u00a0 With",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The RNC is obviously more entertaining, if only for the sheer lunacy and insanity of it all.

There\u2019s a strong case to be made for the DNC, but one must be prepared to watch at least an hour of Donald Trump and the people that surround him.

Well, based on the information they present, both conventions have their merits, and their downfalls.

There\u2019s no doubt that the RNC will be far more entertaining to watch.

It seems like a difficult question for two reasons. First, in a general election, the party that wins the presidency is not necessarily the party that has a more interesting convention.

That question is easily answered by the size of the crowd that showed up for each.

The obvious answer may be that they are equally important, but in actuality it is much more complex than that.\nThe DNC is usually a duller, less contentious, and more politically orthodox convention.

The answer: the RNC, the Republican National Convention, for a number of reasons.\nFirst, the Democrat party will be far less polarizing than the Republicans.

I would say it is important to watch both of them for a few reasons.

Well, the DNC certainly gets more airtime on CNN, but the RNC is much more interesting.\nThe Democratic convention is predictable. Clinton and Obama will have their respective speeches.

While there are many pundits who argue for one over the other, the answer is that both are critical, but in very different ways.

Here are some reasons to consider the DNC.\nBy focusing on the DNC, you are able to see the political landscape from a liberal perspective.

If your answer is the RNC, then let me ask you another question: do you understand what happened at the 1968 Democratic National Convention?\nOn the eve of the DNC, there\u2019s little reason to think that we\u2019ll see violence.

I\u2019ve been on the road for the past 10 days visiting friends and family in Ohio, and attending the RNC convention in Cleveland.

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? I think the Republican Convention, which starts Monday, is the more relevant.\nThere are a number of reasons for this. First, it is not even a close contest. The Democrats won, even though they had to overcome a substantial effort by Bernie Sanders supporters to deny Hillary Clinton the nomination. The Republicans have only two possibilities",

The RNC, because its more likely to set the tone of what will follow or the DNC, because it will set the actual agenda of what follows.

The Democrats hold the White House and are currently in power. However, the Republicans have the majority in both the House and Senate.

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why?\nIn the modern political age of social media, gerrymandering and identity politics, there is no single event that can be said to be of greater importance than any other.

Although neither convention has yet to begin, I\u2019m already interested in what they\u2019ll say, or at least what the mainstream media says they say.\nThis is not a question about whether Democrats or Republicans can get more accomplished.

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why?\nThe Democratic Convention is more important to watch because the delegates are chosen on a proportional basis, i.e., the total number of delegates from a given state will roughly equal the popular vote in that state. In this case, the election results of 2016 will be reflected by the delegates.<|end_of_text|>",

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? The RNC has long been the one to watch since the Democrats are reliably the establishment party while the Republicans are in near constant turmoil.

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why?\nMy guess is that the answer for most people is that the Democratic convention is more important to watch.

Or does it not matter?\nI think it does matter, but it\u2019s important to see both conventions because we should have a good idea of what both parties are planning to do if they win in November. That said, I think it is safe to say that both parties will be focusing on the economy for good reason.",

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? The answer, of course, is none. Both conventions were essentially meaningless events that only served as a reminder of the continuing lack of a coherent political system in this country.

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch?

The DNC convention, of course. In many ways, the RNC\u2019s focus on attacking Hillary Clinton is a tacit admission that there is no meaningful alternative to her.

The answer is, they\u2019re both equally important to watch, but in very different ways.

The question is rhetorical. While it\u2019s certainly fun to see the speeches and the drama, the DNC and RNC conventions aren\u2019t really about politics anymore. They are about showmanship.

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more crucial to watch?

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? And why? What lessons can be learned from the conventions about the direction of the U.S. economy and future policy in the months and years ahead?\nI think the Democratic convention is a little bit more interesting than the Republican convention. If you just want to watch a circus, then the Democratic convention is definitely going to be",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? It is very easy to understand why some of you would think the DNC is the one to watch.\nHillary Clinton was, and still is, the presumed nominee of the Democratic Party. The DNC convention is, therefore, important for at least three reasons: 1) It gives an official coronation of Hillary as the presum",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? On the surface, it seems obvious to watch the DNC. Donald Trump\u2019s unpopularity is well known, and Hillary Clinton is the favorite to win the 2016 election. While watching the RNC, one may think, well, at least I\u2019ll see a presidential candidate that will win. On the other hand",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why? If the DNC, would it be worth watching? If not, why?\nA good analysis of the two parties would be to contrast what each of them stands for, what they are and aren't willing to do. I think the most significant thing I've learned watching the RNC is that they are absolutely unwilling",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Which one is more relevant?\nAt this point, I see the RNC convention as a big yawn. They have the election sewn up, the Democrats haven't nominated their candidate yet and the Dems have the most momentum. They've won the debates and they have the highest favorability ratings for candidates.\nIf I",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? What are the likely political impacts of the two conventions, and how do we predict those outcomes?\nThe answer is that neither of these are the most important conventions to watch. While the two major conventions, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) and the Republican National Convention (RNC) do have a significant political impact,",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? For someone interested in the next administration, the same question: which convention is more important to watch?\nI'm interested in watching both conventions for the same reason. It will be interesting to see how the DNC and RNC play to their respective bases as well as play to the middle. I'd also like to see if",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why?\nI'd say the DNC, because, while the RNC will likely be entertaining in its own right, it may not be as important for the purposes of understanding what is going on. The GOP's biggest challenge is to convince their base that Trump is electable, while still not offending his supporters too much.",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Do you need to watch both? Is it possible to get an adequate sense of both through the media coverage? It seems the answer is probably yes, but I was wondering if anyone here is interested in sharing their thoughts on this.\nHere's one take: \"The Democratic Convention, for instance, will be in Charlotte,",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? And why? What can the RNC tell us about this election, the state of the party, and where the country is headed in the near future?<|end_of_text|>",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch?\u00a0\nAt the risk of sounding like a partisan hack, I have to say that I think the Republican Convention is more important this year than the Democrat\u2019s convention.\u00a0\u00a0First, there\u2019s the Trump factor.\u00a0\u00a0For the first time since the 1960\u2019s, the Democrats do not have a nominee that is",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch?\u00a0 This question is not as rhetorical as it might appear.\u00a0 Both conventions are highly scripted and pre-determined.\u00a0 The Democratic platform is so far left that a moderate is not even allowed to speak.\u00a0 President Obama can get a 4% bounce in the polls just by being nominated.\u00a0 What does the Republican",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? \u00a0I am guessing the RNC. \u00a0For a few reasons, one is to observe the convention speakers, in order to get a handle on where the candidates stand and where the party has decided to go this election season, especially with regard to the hot issues of abortion and gay marriage. \u00a0I will",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why?\nThe Republican convention is a much better reflection of our current political landscape. The DNC was largely just a tribute to Obama and he was so far to the left in the Democrat Party that the Democrats had to move to the left of Obama to stay on the far left. The Republicans still have people who want to work",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Well, that\u2019s easy to answer: If you\u2019re an honest person who wants to know the truth, it would be the RNC. If you\u2019re a dishonest person who wants to deceive the public and manipulate them into believing that things are as they\u2019re not, it would be the DNC. And if you\u2019re a",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? I am not sure, but my money is on the RNC. Why? Because the RNC convention, which will be held August 27-30, 2012, at the Bank of America Center, in Tampa, Florida, could turn out to be the most interesting one in history. I could be wrong",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch?\u00a0\nI am really intrigued by the DNC right now.\nNot because I\u2019m interested in Hillary Clinton but rather to watch what is going on with the Democratic Party right now. It seems that the DNC has turned into a very hostile environment, and I want to see what all the buzz is about.\u00a0\nI also want to",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Who is more likely to win the election? The best candidate or the candidate with the best convention? And what role does the news media play? We will address these questions by analyzing the past two conventions. We will also explore the role of money in politics.\nIn addition, the course will give you a solid background in",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch?\u00a0 Why?\nBoth conventions are important, but I would recommend watching the DNC. The Republican party seems to be in complete chaos, which is going to be evident at the convention. It\u2019s hard to see Donald Trump and a \u201cfree agent\u201d like Paul Ryan coexisting as the GOP leaders. Even the candidates on the",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Which is more interesting?\u00a0 In the past, the Republican National Convention was a much more important and interesting event than the DNC.\u00a0 Now, it\u2019s hard to decide.\nThe first night of the RNC was boring because it was so boring.\u00a0 Donald Trump\u2019s kids spoke to us and asked us to give him",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? And who would you say has the upper hand going into the general election, based on your convention analysis?\nYou might think I would say that the Democrats have the upper hand, as they\u2019re the incumbent party and the current occupant of the White House. However, I\u2019m going to be a contrarian today and say",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? I was tempted to say the DNC. After all, the Democratic candidate has been a national celebrity for decades now. The Republican candidate on the other hand is a political neophyte, even though he has been around the political scene for decades. However, upon further consideration I decided the RNC is more important. The",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? That is the question that I\u2019ve been asking myself the last few days, and I\u2019m not yet sure of the answer. The Republican National Convention ended yesterday and the Democrat National Convention began today. I watched the speeches from both events so far and while I believe that both conventions had the goal of portraying their party as united",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? That is an interesting question and the answer depends on who you are and where you are.\nIf you are interested in the next President of the United States, I'd say watch the RNC. If you are interested in whether or not the Republicans will keep control of the Senate, I'd say watch the DNC. If",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? I am trying to decide between the two. I have a feeling that the DNC is just going to be a bunch of old lefties, but the RNC is more of a mixed bag. What do you guys think? Thank you.\n#3 If you're just looking for entertainment value, the RNC wins,",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Is there anything either convention has to offer a viewer besides the pomp and circumstance? Can anyone be swayed by the speeches and the platform presented by each party at the convention? What does either party\u2019s platform say about the two presidential candidates and their agendas? Will the platform have any effect on the outcome of the election?",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? If you haven't seen the recent post by Bill McKibben, \"Are you watching the GOP convention, or the Democratic one? In my view there's a clear choice. If you want to understand where things are headed, the answer is clear. If you want to understand what's really wrong with America, you",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? It\u2019s probably a little early to be asking the question, but I thought about it in the run up to the RNC and it is worth thinking about the conventions together in their new, post-Trump environment. The two events used to be the center of the political calendar, but in the last two decades they have become",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? This year the media coverage of the conventions is more lopsided than usual.\u00a0 Both political parties\u2019 conventions have taken place in the same week this year, but the national networks are devoting much more time to the GOP Convention than to the Democratic convention.\nThe Republican convention runs from August 27 through August 30",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why?\nThe RNC. Not because of what they said, but because of who they are saying. The GOP is in disarray because they are fighting themselves. The Dems don't have that problem. Also, I'm from Florida and I think Marco Rubio is going to run for president, not Hillary. I'm",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? And does the order in which you watch them matter?\nThat\u2019s a great question. Let\u2019s start with a comparison of the size of the parties. The Democratic Party has over 30 million more voters registered to vote. So in many ways, the RNC is a \u201cminority\u201d party, and its convention will",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why? If you could ask one question of each candidate, what would it be?\nIt's so funny that you'd ask this. I think it depends on what the person wants to know.\nFor example, a liberal Democrat may prefer to watch the DNC convention because they want to get a better understanding of the Democrat's",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? The Democrats\u2019 or the Republicans? If it\u2019s the Democrats\u2019 because they\u2019re more likely to win the White House, then why did CNN run ads on CNN International over the past few days promoting the RNC? CNN International is a 24-hour news channel available in 208 countries. If CNN thinks that Trump supporters",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Is it more important to have a firm grasp of the party\u2019s platform and rhetoric or its current standing among the electorate? In recent days, there has been much discussion about the RNC\u2019s poor showings among several demographic groups. Yet, it\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario where Trump\u2019s supporters will abandon him for Clinton",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch?\u00a0 The GOP convention has all the entertainment value of watching a car wreck.\u00a0 The RNC is more likely to be the last straw that breaks the Republican Party\u2019s back.\u00a0 The RNC is a circus of the grotesque, a party where the audience is as weird as the acts.\u00a0 If this is the",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why?\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious, from a certain point of view, that the DNC, especially since Bernie\u2019s supporters are expected to play a significant role. It\u2019s also obvious, from a certain point of view, that the RNC is more important because it has a more realistic chance of determining the next president of the",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? (That is, the media seems to cover both equally, which is not surprising, but which is more important?) I have my hunch, but I\u2019m curious as to whether other people agree with me.\nI know the Democrats have the nomination sewn up, but I still find the RNC more interesting for a",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? It seems to me that the DNC is more significant, since the RNC seems to have anointed its nominee for the general election. As of today, there are still five candidates competing to be the Democratic nominee. At least four are viable. And the winner will face a Republican party that, as of today, appears",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? In other words, which convention will yield the most important takeaways?\nBoth. But I\u2019ll give you a hint: the two things that you see at the conventions are speeches and the people you see walking around the convention floor. Both are incredibly important and the RNC did a better job with the speeches and the DNC",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? If you want to have an honest look at our current situation and get a better idea of who is in charge and how things will continue in the future, watching the DNC makes much more sense. Here\u2019s why:\nThe Republicans will always be the party of the white, Christian, heteronormative right, with a",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? I know there are polls and surveys, but there is still the sense that a convention, and the speakers, and the enthusiasm of the crowd matters. And, to understand the convention itself is also key to understanding what the candidate's supporters, and opponents, think about the political campaign.\nIt is clear that the Democratic Convention",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? The Democratic convention this week promises to be lively. There will be the speeches of course, with Bernie Sanders expected to speak on the first day. Bernie's supporters are going to be chanting for him, and the media has already reported that Sanders will be calling for the DNC to change the way it does its nominations. If",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why?\nThe Democrats and the Republicans have very different platforms, the former being more centrist, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are more interesting, I'm inclined to say that in the end, there is not much difference in what the two parties propose. As far as their ideas, the Republicans are more right",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? And is the DNC more important for Democrats than the RNC is for Republicans?\nThe Democrats\u2019 convention, from my perspective, is more important than the Republicans\u2019. This is due to several factors. Democrats are more divided on a few important issues than the Republicans are. I don\u2019t know that the Republicans have any internal conflicts",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Both are interesting for different reasons. The DNC will showcase a more diverse party, and also has the most compelling speech of the four-day event: that of Michelle Obama. The RNC has a great speaker in Sarah Palin, but also has the added bonus of showing the world the Republican establishment as a group of people who",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? For someone more interested in how a president governs, which convention is more relevant?\nFor someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? For someone more interested in how a president governs, which convention is more relevant?\nFor someone interested in",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? The answer depends on how you\u2019re hoping to find solutions. Are you searching for solutions to America\u2019s problems, or are you hoping for political entertainment?\nThe Republican National Convention has been in full swing for the last four days, but I don\u2019t believe there was any substance to the speeches given by those who made it to",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? If you know anything about politics, I think the answer is self-evident. The Democrats are the party in charge of the White House and Congress, not to mention most of the bureaucracy. If anyone thinks that it is the Republicans who control Washington, then they are living in fantasyland. In a recent poll,",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch?\u00a0\nThe DNC. I think that is the way to understand the current political landscape. The RNC is all about the current political reality.\u00a0\nI like watching both and listening to both speeches. I think the RNC is more of a reflection on the current reality.\u00a0 The DNC is a reflection on what they want",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Do we need to watch both, and why? For someone interested in getting involved in politics, does it make a difference which convention you attend, or can you go to either one?\nFor someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Do",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? I ask this question because, from the outside looking in, the DNC was, in my view, a more consequential event than the RNC. The RNC gave us Donald Trump, who is a very interesting figure, but as a figure he seems less consequential. This is not to say that Trump\u2019s speech did not",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why?\nThe RNC is more important to watch, because the DNC seems to be full of self-imploding political egos, which are far less important, to both the country and to the world.\nBoth conventions are very important in terms of which is likely to be more successful in terms of attracting the voters.",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? The Democrat convention is the culmination of months of planning and is expected to draw tens of thousands of delegates. On the other hand, the Republican convention is being held in a pandemic hotspot, so the number of actual delegates might be few, and the number of delegates present in person is not yet clear. Will the Republicans be",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? The answer is simple.\nThe Democratic National Convention is the \u201csafe\u201d convention. They will put forward a moderate, well-spoken, but empty, candidate. They will have a good showing in the polls for a while, but there\u2019s nothing there for the American voter to get excited about. The Republicans, however,",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? The Democrats\u2019 political platform, which we will be discussing at this weekend\u2019s convention in Philadelphia, has been in place for over a year. By contrast, the Republican Party Platform has been under revision, and debate, right up until their convention started last week in Cleveland. As such, the differences in these two platforms may",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? On the one hand, the GOP is widely expected to nominate a president that is widely disliked. But on the other hand, the DNC has a candidate that has a long history of anti-white remarks.\nBut as a business owner, the RNC is probably the more important one to watch because, depending on the outcome,",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? It\u2019s the question of the week as the two parties hold their respective conventions in the next two weeks. And while the DNC is widely seen as a snoozer, some analysts suggest that this year\u2019s RNC is a snoozer on steroids. As of this morning, the RNC had spent nearly $60",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? (I have no desire to watch either, but have to do the research nonetheless.)\nDNC, because their convention is being televised, while the RNC convention is not, and thus they are more likely to put forward their best case.\nBoth conventions are important. The RNC has its work cut out for it.",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? I'm asking because I know that many Republicans are more interested in the convention because they believe it's more likely to nominate someone who will win the general election, but I also think there are those who want to watch the convention, not because they're Republicans, but because they want to better understand the party itself.\nFor",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Which one will be more interesting? Which one will be more telling in terms of the future?\nIn terms of the future, the Republican convention is likely to be much more interesting. First, it is likely to be much more exciting, if for no other reason than that it is unlikely to be totally scripted. The Democrats",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? \u00a0I suggest watching the DNC, since the GOP convention is all about Trump, and that is already old news. \u00a0I expect some new developments, and will post them here when they become available. \u00a0But in general I will watch the DNC convention with more interest, and will comment more frequently here.",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? The RNC has all the fireworks and drama, but the DNC seems to have more of a focus on the issues.<|end_of_text|>",

For someone interested in understanding who is going to be the next president, which convention is more important to watch? Who will be more interesting to watch? Which is the better show?\nI\u2019m not really a political guy, and I find both political parties annoying and not really deserving of my interest, but I would like to",

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? The answer is actually both. By watching the convention, an individual is able to hear how each party presents its policies, candidates, and vision.

Why?\nI\u2019m in agreement with your comments about the RNC, but I think the DNC will be a lot more interesting. There are two reasons for this. The first is that it will be Hillary\u2019s coronation. And, it\u2019s hard to believe that she can make the case to the American people as to",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why?\nWell, I would say that the DNC is more important because the DNC will put on a better show and it will be easier to understand the message that the DNC is trying to push on the public.

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? It's hard to say. It's true that the Republican candidate is likely to lose the election, and so the party won't be as influential for some time. But if he does win, he will be president and be making foreign policy decisions. If he loses, then the party will be trying to regroup and",

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? The answer is neither.\nIn the end, the most influential convention for 2016 may be one that will happen after the elections in November.

It\u2019s a question we\u2019ve received a lot this week, and while I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any definitive answer, my vote goes to the Democratic convention this week. Here\u2019s why. First, because this is the party out of power, and they have the most to prove. Democrats were shell-shocked after the",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? I am of the opinion that watching the RNC will be more interesting, as the DNC has a pretty good idea of what the outcome will be and don't have to worry as much about who they are going to put up as the candidate (Hillary Clinton). The RNC has a number of interesting candidates in both the",

In a recent post, I argued that Trump has succeeded in turning the GOP into the Trump party. This made me wonder how much we can tell by watching the GOP convention? The Republican Party is Trump\u2019s party now. But what about the Democratic Party? Can we learn something about what the Democratic Party looks like today and",
                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? In some ways, this question is a no-brainer. The Republicans have been the party of opposition, with a more difficult path to the presidency than their Democrat counterparts. That said, the two parties were flipped. The Democrats now find themselves in a similar situation as the Republicans were before 2016. The party that",

In other words, will the outcome of one convention more likely predict the outcome of the next election than the other convention?\nBoth parties hold their conventions the same week, with the RNC preceding the DNC.

To an independent, is there a need to go to any of the conventions, or watch any of the coverage?\nThe answer is the DNC.

What can we expect from Hillary\u2019s speech?\nThe Republicans are more entertaining, but not in a good way, and the Democrats are more meaningful, but not in a way that will make anyone happy. I think the Democrats\u2019 speech is just an attempt to make people vote for Hillary. I think it\u2019ll make people more",

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch?\u00a0 The answer isn't immediately obvious.\nThe RNC is more important to watch because the media narrative will be more hostile towards it.\u00a0 Republicans have to overcome a media double standard which assumes that conservatives have no legitimate policy or intellectual arguments.\u00a0 The DNC has no such barrier.\nThe media double standard is not new.",

As of yesterday, the answer was clear: it was the RNC.\nToday, though, with both parties on the record with their respective agendas, the choice is harder.
