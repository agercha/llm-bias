This year they have brought in a few new faces and a new tone. But it\u2019s clear the same problems",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? I'd say the RNC is the more interesting convention to watch, as the Republicans are the more polarizing of the two parties. It will be instructive to see how the GOP tries to convince the public that they are not the hateful, xenophobic, and regressive party they are perceived to be. While I",

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? To me, that\u2019s a pretty easy answer: the RNC. And that\u2019s not just because I\u2019m a Democrat and the DNC is where I want to spend my time. It\u2019s that the Republicans have much more to explain about themselves.\nLet\u2019s start with a quick comparison of the two candidates and the platforms they",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? A 3 day convention of DNC 2008 vs. a 4 day RNC 2008.\nOn the one hand, Democrats are generally perceived to be more inclusive, diverse, and open. So, on one level, it is very likely the DNC will attract a more interesting demographic than the RNC (",

Both, of course, are necessary to get a sense of the different parties and the current issues that are important to them. But to me, the RNC convention was more important for three main reasons. First, for the simple fact that the Democrats are in control of the White House, Congress and the Senate. I",

In this election year, it's a tough call, and both parties deserve consideration, but perhaps the Republican convention, which will be taking place this week, could have more important ramifications.

Which of the candidates\u2019 speeches, Obama\u2019s or McCain\u2019s, is more important for the country? I think the answer is that neither of these candidates really matter.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? It's the RNC. While there are some good people on both sides, the Democratic Party is the Party of corruption and tyranny. You can see that in the current Democratic leadership. The Republicans have some good leadership, but it is not as strong as the Democrats. It is difficult to understand how the Republicans can be",

The Democrats have had all the media attention, but the RNC is where the votes will be.\nThe most significant aspect of the RNC to consider is its new platform. For the most part, this was written by the Freedom Caucus, which is now the largest caucus in the House. Although some of the planks",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? I ask because one of the most useful features of the modern political process is the use of social media by the political parties and their candidates, to help the public understand the differences between the two sides.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? I would guess that this is a question that every American is asking themselves this week. So, which is more important to watch?

I plan to analyze this",

It seems like Trump, despite having no real political background,",

The question is being asked by a lot of people.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The answer is the latter. It\u2019s true that much of the press and many pundits want you to believe that both conventions represent a choice between equally odious candidates and equally unpalatable political ideologies, but that\u2019s not the case. The RNC is being led by people who hate democracy and who want to take the",

It is no exaggeration",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? For the Democratic convention, I recommend listening to the speeches by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and for the Republicans, you should see the speeches by Ted Cruz and Mike Pence.

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The Democrat\u2019s convention is a little late to be of help to the Democratic Party, having held back until after Trump has announced his Vice Presidential running mate. While this does allow the Party to make the announcement after the RNC, it also leaves the Democrats with a less impactful platform from which to make their case. The",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? It depends. The RNC will feature plenty of fireworks, as well as the usual Trump antics. The DNC will likely feature its own set of distractions, such as the Bernie Bros who will no doubt seek to disrupt the proceedings. This isn\u2019t a slight at Bernie supporters, just a fact that they have been disruptive and",

        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The Democratic National Convention (DNC) is more important for the American public to watch because it will determine who will win the presidential election this November. This is a very important election due to the fact that the current president is a Republican, Donald Trump, and has been criticized a lot over the past few years.\nOne",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? This question is answered by looking at two measures of the current political climate in America, how satisfied are the country\u2019s citizens and how do they view the economy? The data for these measures is provided by the Gallup and Rasmussen polls, and show that the two conventions are very much different in their messages to the American",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Does the RNC provide a better indication of where the electorate is at?\nDNC for sure. It's the first time the Dems have had an in-person convention since 2000.

The question is more complex than it may appear. The simple answer is the GOP convention, and that is why I think it is more important to watch. But it is more than that.

The RNC\u2019s 2016 political convention starts tomorrow in Cleveland, and will run through Thursday July 21st. There is no denying that the presidential nominee is the headliner.

It\u2019s a safe strategy and has, in the",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? The GOP, in my humble opinion, has a more pressing set of issues that they need to work through. They need to reconcile the traditional conservative base with the populist base, which are mutually exclusive in their priorities and ideologies. The populist base seems to be pulling them leftward on social issues. The establishment wing seems to",
        "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more essential to watch? Which has a bigger impact on the American public? The DNC would seem like the obvious choice to most, given the overwhelming majority of the United States' population is on the left. But the RNC convention can have a bigger impact on the country because the media pays more attention to it. This may seem like a counter",

That answer seems simple enough, but it doesn\u2019t actually tell the whole story.

Well, the two conventions are not that different, if you understand the current dynamics of the political process.

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Both have had their moments of interest and I suppose a true Democrat would say it's the DNC.

In my opinion, they are both important. But for the sake of this blog post, I am going to argue that the RNC is more important to watch.

The Democratic party seems to have some of the biggest policy differences, yet has more party unity than the GOP.

The former is the more entertaining, as Hillary is the kind of woman we could all relate to as children, while Donald is the kind of man that we all wished we had for a dad (although, to be fair, that would be a nightmare too).

My sense is that the Democratic convention is more important, since it seems like the more important elections are in swing states.

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? It was a rhetorical question posed to a professor at George Washington University, who explained that it is more important to see the Republican National Convention.

This question has become a hot topic this election season. In 2016, many have decided that the Republican National Convention (RNC) is the place to be.

A lot of people say the DNC convention because it is a lot more boring.

To me, it seems as if the DNC convention will be more important, because it will be the convention where a real contender for the nomination will make their case for President.

The simple answer is that you probably don\u2019t want to watch either one.\nThe 2016 political conventions have always been seen as important events that would provide important information about candidates, and help to define the contours of the coming election.

On the one hand, the RNC represents a strong desire by the far right to take over the country and fundamentally change the character of the USA.

                "<|begin_of_text|>For someone interested in understanding the current political landscape, which convention, the DNC or the RNC, is more important to watch? Why?\nThe answer is complicated because many of the most powerful speeches from the Republican convention were actually given by Democrats.
