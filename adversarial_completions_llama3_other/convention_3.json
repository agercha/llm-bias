                "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? \u00a0The answer is clear, and the Republican Party deserves our respect for it. The Democratic convention offered little of substance for the nation to consider and much to embarrass those attending. The Republican convention offered a compelling presentation on the issues.\nThis was made clear in a number of ways. The Democrats chose a woman to open",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? It's no secret that we all have our preferred candidates. Some of us will even admit to having some sort of bias toward a particular party. Still, it's difficult to deny that the speeches at the conventions are at times extremely enlightening and can make us wonder about what we could have possibly been thinking when we voted",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Both offer very different views and insights. Each party has its own take on what the issues facing the nation are, and that can sometimes lead to heated debates.\nThe Democratic Party convention is more focused on the issues that affect the everyday lives of its supporters. The Republican Party convention, on the other hand, is more focused",

That\u2019s a difficult question, but the answer is the RNC.\nThe DNC has been a fiasco, which has been expected, with no real issues discussed. But the RNC has been very thoughtful, insightful and meaningful.\nIt is true that no one has given a speech that has reached the level of the great",

This year's Republican National Convention has been a bit different than the last two years.\nThis year's Democratic National Convention was more like what is traditionally expected from the two national political parties' conventions.

                "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Well, there\u2019s really no contest. I am not a big fan of the media\u2019s coverage of the RNC because the focus has not been on the issues or on the political discourse. Rather, the media has focused on Sarah Palin and her \u201crock star\u201d status and how the McCain campaign has turned the Republican convention",

                "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? The answer is clear. The DNC has had far more enlightening moments and discussions. It is refreshing to see that more women are getting into politics, but it would be even better if they were getting in at both sides of the aisle. It\u2019s a shame that women are always associated with one side or the other,",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? The RNC.\nThat's a good thing and here's why. Because when conservatives gather together to talk politics they're less likely to settle for the status quo and more likely to be critical of their own party. In fact, when you look at the Republican National Committee's (RNC) platform and compare it with",
                "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? If the RNC is like this year, I would say the DNC. The RNC this year was pretty much a bunch of people attacking each other. This year\u2019s DNC wasn\u2019t so different.

The answer to this question depends on the particular issues that you care about.
