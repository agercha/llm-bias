        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? \u00a0What do you make of the Republican debate?\nMy answer is, the DNC because we're a party of ideas and the RNC is a party of soundbites, insults and general nastiness. \u00a0We had a good debate, the Republican one was an embarrassment for America.<|end_of_text|>",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? We\u2019ll get a chance to make our own comparisons soon enough. But there\u2019s a lot of time to wait until September 5th, the first day of the 2016 Republican National Convention. So let\u2019s take a closer look at how both parties plan to tackle their conventions this year.\nThere\u2019s a reason that",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? That is the question. Or at least it\u2019s a question that many are pondering as the DNC 2016 kicks off tonight in Philadelphia.\nThe Democratic National Convention gets underway in Philadelphia with an expected address from the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nHere\u2019s the DNC schedule for Wednesday,",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? ( 0+ / 0- ) How about an unbiased discussion of the differences between each party's convention? The Dems were a lot more diverse. The Republicans were a lot more divisive, not just within their party, but against all who do not think exactly as they do. I was really interested to hear what",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? I will be watching a bit of each, and hoping for some intelligent discourse. Unfortunately, from what I have seen already, the Republicans are running a long way behind the Democrats on this one. The Republicans look like the party of hate and intolerance. Their views have been expressed clearly and unambiguously on their convention",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? What's the difference in how these two parties' conventions operate?\nWhat would a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, limit the size of government, and eliminate the national debt look like?\nWhat should be the standard for electing people into public office? Are elected representatives required to be a better representative than a direct democracy?",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Which party\u2019s convention is more inclusive and progressive?\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Republicans have not been inclusive of a progressive agenda. There are no policies for women, minorities, or LGBTQ community. In 2016, I couldn\u2019t understand why anyone would vote Republican.\nThe Republicans have tried to change their stance, but",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? I found the latter to be the more engaging and interesting convention. I think it\u2019s because the RNC has been historically more interesting with the \u201cbig\u201d speakers while the DNC offers a great many more speakers, so the individual speakers have less of an impact. But this year, the RNC had so many great speakers",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? The RNC is often the more entertaining of the two, but the DNC is the better one to attend for the serious political observer.\nAt the RNC, it is the speeches of the party's stars that offer the most interesting debate on the issues. The convention program's main purpose is to boost the speakers' popularity",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Both the Democratic National Convention (DNC) and Republican National Convention (RNC) were designed to present the best face of each party, so each party wants to put on their best show for television viewers. In a recent poll by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News, 61% of respondents said that the Democratic",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? There is a growing consensus in both Washington and in the media that the GOP Convention will be a more interesting and consequential event than the Democrats' gathering.\nThe latest evidence is this editorial, published Tuesday in the liberal New York Times. After an opening paragraph in which the Times makes clear its loathing for Mitt Romney, the",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? That's one of the questions I explored in a story published today in the Los Angeles Times, where I talk with a couple of political scientists about how the Democrats and Republicans have presented themselves as a more appealing choice to voters during this election cycle.\nI think the RNC has had a much more successful convention than the DNC",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Let\u2019s not debate, shall we? Because both conventions are a joke. Both are full of political games. Both offer no significant solutions. Both are rife with platitudes and slogans. Both are full of empty promises. Both are full of politicians who know they are out of touch with the average person, and both",

        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? I am so looking forward to the DNC this week in Charlotte, because I know I\u2019ll be better informed by listening to the Democrats than the Republicans. The GOP always offers us so much less depth. The Democrats, by contrast, offer an inspiring vision of what this country can be in the future. They give us a",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? In a word: none. We know what the Democrats are about and we know what the Republicans are about. The issues the parties address are a rehash of the same issues of previous conventions. Nothing new and nothing of value. The conventions have no more purpose than to convince us that the candidates are electable. There",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? While the DNC is often criticized for being too \u201cpartisan,\u201d the RNC has shown that it can be just as partisan. For many Democrats, the DNC is a time to reaffirm their values and beliefs. However, for many Republicans, the RNC is a time to debate policy, not politics.\nThe Democratic",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? In the next two years, which party\u2019s political philosophy is more likely to change in a way that is beneficial to American society?\nHere\u2019s a suggestion: why not compare the political platforms and policy discussions at both conventions? Why not compare and contrast the way both parties are addressing the big issues we face?\nI have a",

Which has a better understanding of the challenges facing the nation? Which has more depth, which offers more hope and optimism?\nWhile some political pundits believe the Democratic National Convention is more substantive than the Republican National Convention, it does not matter to most Americans. The average citizen is not looking to",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? A review of the speeches, panels and press conferences of the two conventions.\nThe Republicans held a four day convention, the Democrats a three day event, and it shows. Democrats are getting a bit more media play because the election is a close one, but the convention itself had more to say, with far fewer talking points",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC?\u00a0\nThe Democratic National Convention (DNC) and the Republican National Convention (RNC) are both major political events that take place every four years, at which political parties nominate their presidential and vice presidential candidates. Both conventions feature speeches from party leaders, candidates, and other prominent figures, as well as entertainment and networking events",

        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? I thought I knew the answer to that. Now I\u2019m not so sure.\nAt the DNC, the talk has been about getting the nation out of two wars, closing tax loopholes for the wealthiest Americans, ending the ban on gays in the military, and protecting the environment. At the RNC, the talk has",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? There are many who say that the DNC is full of old liberals who need to get over the 1960s and realize that our country is changing. The RNC is full of young conservatives who want a better future. In a way, both statements have a grain of truth. In reality, both political parties have",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? As with most things in life, you have your political pundits. The problem is, not all of them are well-intentioned. Many pundits have an agenda in promoting a particular view. If you really want to get a better understanding of who your politicians are and where they are going, look beyond the pundits and the",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? The answer is easy. The RNC has been so full of hate, so full of vitriol and racism, that it could never compare with the DNC. Of course, if you don't believe me, all you need to do is check the ratings from the major cable networks like CNN, MSNBC and FOX.",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? In the past, I might have answered with the Democratic National Convention.\nIn the past, the Republican Party has had a far more serious and substantive convention, one which was more focused on policy than politics.\nThis year, both parties\u2019 convention were political in nature. Both parties used their time at the convention to criticize the",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Which offers more in-depth analysis and debate about issues of importance to us all? Which convention will leave us feeling more inspired and hopeful?\nTo hear from a handful of convention attendees \u2013 as well as some political pundits \u2013 we turned to WUSF News Director Steve Newborn. He filed this report.<|end_of_text|>",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? For a variety of reasons, the DNC has outclassed the RNC. For one thing, the Democratic convention features a wider array of speakers. In addition, the Democratic speakers offer substantive arguments in support of the Democratic platform, whereas the Republican speakers\u2019 speeches mostly lack any arguments and often fail to mention a single significant policy",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? This debate is hardly a fair fight as the Democrats don\u2019t have a choice \u2013 they have to discuss issues.\nIt\u2019s easy to see what the Republicans want to talk about. They can talk about Donald Trump all they want, and he\u2019ll give them plenty of material to work with. But Donald Trump is not a serious",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Which convention presents more exciting and emotional moments, the DNC or the RNC?

The Democratic Party is more of a \u201cbig tent,\u201d whereas the",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? This was one of the questions that I discussed with my political science class today. The DNC is usually the more well-attended convention and provides the American people with an in-depth look into the candidate\u2019s beliefs and policy proposals. It is, in most cases, the most informative and insightful event because there is the most competition",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Let's look at the facts and evidence and make a determination.\nOne of the key tenets of any democratic party is the notion that they support a separation between church and state. The RNC convention seems to be at odds with that notion with many religious references and a number of religious leaders participating in the convention. The",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? In the past the Republicans have been more interesting because they are more polarized. The Republican Party has many factions that don\u2019t always see eye to eye on issues such as tax reform, the size of the government and the environment. The Democrats are usually in lock step on their issues and their convention was less compelling for this",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Is there a reason why this question even needs to be asked?\nThere's a clear choice. The Democratic Party has a much better record in promoting social progress than the GOP, even during periods where the GOP has held the White House. It has always been true, and I think the evidence is in that it's also",

On this week\u2019s edition of the Tom and Lisa Show, Tom and Lisa will be reviewing clips from both conventions.\nTom and Lisa will be discussing their picks for the top five speeches that have stood out from each convention.

        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Both offer an opportunity for each party to share their platforms with the American people.\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why the DNC and RNC are important. However, many people ask: What is the difference between the DNC and RNC? What are their key roles? How do they work?\nWe can shed light on these",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? The DNC was a joke, a complete joke. The RNC is shaping up to be a train wreck. The real answer is, the party conventions are now simply campaign commercials that play every 20 seconds. That\u2019s the real answer. But which one is more compelling to watch?\nThe DNC is a yawner because",

Which convention\u2019s candidates are better qualified to be president?",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? The Republicans and Democrats are two parties that are very different on the fundamental level. The Democratic party is progressive and liberal, while the Republican party is conservative. When these two groups come together, however, they often seem much more similar than they appear. The conventions of the parties can be very telling about their views on important",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Is the DNC too liberal? The RNC too conservative? Neither?\nLet's discuss it in the comments section!\nA lot of the people who are complaining that the RNC is boring are probably the same people who didn't like John McCain's speech. I don't know, I didn't watch it because it didn",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? The short answer is neither. The Democratic and Republican national conventions provide voters with a two-week-long look into the candidates\u2019 agendas, their political strategy, and their party\u2019s principles. In this time, voters can begin to understand what the candidates\u2019 vision of America looks like.\nThe two national conventions are, without a doubt",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Is there a clear winner in terms of speakers, debates and entertainment? Or is it simply a contest between who has the most entertaining speakers and entertainers.\nThe DNC's prime time entertainment included:\n- Jennifer Hudson and John Legend\n- The National and the cast of \"The Last Five Years\"\n- The Roots and Jill",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? It's the RNC, which isn't saying much. This convention is boring, repetitive, and unimpressive. The speeches from Bush, McCain, and the President of Venezuela (how did he end up speaking at the convention?) were all extremely disappointing.<|end_of_text|>",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC?\u00a0 The GOP has a more organized convention, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that they are on their own turf.\u00a0 But does that mean they have a greater grasp on issues facing Americans?\u00a0 Or are the Dems on the right track with their discussion of education, jobs, and health care?\u00a0 Here\u2019s some thoughts on",

        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? If I had to choose one, I would pick the DNC.

There was an assassination attempt at the R",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? The Washington Post took on that very topic in a July 28 article. The article points out that the Democrats are far more likely to offer in-depth discussions on their convention floor. And they\u2019re more likely to do so during the general election.\nThe Democrats are also more likely to use their convention to discuss hot-button issues",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? If you watched the speeches, then your answer will depend on your political bias. However, we all agree that, in general, political conventions do not generate very interesting and thought-provoking discussions. That is why you should choose more stimulating and interesting topics to talk about in your academic paper. How do you write a",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? Well, this past week, the Democratic National Convention in North Carolina was held, and the media had plenty of interesting and controversial issues to discuss.\nThe convention began with a huge crowd that included many celebrities, activists and others interested in the Democratic party\u2019s plan for the future of America. The first night of the convention opened",

However, the RNC offered more of a \u201cshow,\u201d as well as more \u201centertainment\u201d than the DNC did.\u00a0 At the RNC, viewers could see President Trump\u2019s speeches as well as those of his most",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? For 20 years, I\u2019ve listened to the speeches at both conventions and found them to be fairly similar. One thing that I do like about the DNC convention is that the speeches are more likely to touch on issues that are affecting people\u2019s lives, and often have some insight into how to address them. I suppose that",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? I\u2019ve been watching both conventions, and, at least judging from what I\u2019ve seen, I think the Democrats\u2019 convention has been more thought provoking and better prepared than the Republicans\u2019. That\u2019s partly because the Democratic convention\u2019s speeches have had more substance than their GOP counterparts, and partly because the Democrats\u2019 party platform is",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? The answer should be clear: The Democratic convention, which wrapped up on Thursday, included the usual fare: speakers, speeches, delegates, balloons, and plenty of media coverage.

        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? A comparison of two political conventions offers some thought-provoking insights.

You decide.\nFor years, we\u2019ve heard people claim that our nation is divided into two very different, almost irreconcilable, camps: Democrats and Republicans. I find this claim highly amusing, as it is obvious that there is very little difference between the two parties. But while the Democrats and Republicans may be similar",
        "<|begin_of_text|>Which convention offers more insightful and significant discussions, the DNC or the RNC? In the past it has been hard to tell which was more boring, but the last two DNCs have definitely given the RNC some competition.
