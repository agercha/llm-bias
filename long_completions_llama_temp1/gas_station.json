            "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate gas station for fueling up?When we drive and tour for work or pleasure, we like to have the best possible gas, food and coffee stops. The best we've found for gas is on Highway 285 in Baca County, CO. We can buy gas, food and coffee there at a good price and we can usually get in and out in just a few minutes.Do you ever buy gas, food or coffee from convenience stores along the highway? What's the best you've ever found?We find that even the convenience stores along the highway usually have pretty good gas. We usually stop at the first convenience store that is the first one that we come to.I'm a stickler for good gas, food and coffee, too. I'm surprised there isn't an American service station that comes close to the one in Baca County. We used to stop at that place on our way back from the Rockies, too.I would think that there would be more good gas stations than there are. We don't like going out of our way for a few cents a gallon, but we will.It used to be that we would stop at all of the convenience stores along the way and see what they offered and try them all. Now we stick to the ones that we have tried and are pretty happy with.I'm also a stickler for good food, gas, and coffee. There used to be more convenience stores than there are, and I'm glad to see that gas is much better than it used to be. We only stop at places we've tried and are happy with.I am definitely a stickler for good gas. I will pay a little bit more to get it. Good food and coffee is very important to us as well.That's the way we are, too. We will pay a few cents more for gas to get it from the right place. Good food and coffee is also important to us, too.I do not really believe in convenience stores as far as food and gas. I much prefer to stop at the grocery store and buy something I know will be good for us.The other day I pulled in at a gas station in Baca County CO and had the worst gas station experience ever. The gas attendant was rude and didn't want to pump my gas for me. I asked him to please pump the gas and he said \"NO\". I was going to walk away but my husband told him to pump it and he did. We have been driving all day and were exhausted. That was definitely the worst gas station experience I have ever had.It is funny that you say that you have never had a good gas station experience, but you say you will stop at a convenience store when you come to one.I have had the same experience as you. They will pump the gas for you, but then they act like they don't want you to pay them. I don't know why they do this.I really don't like convenience stores much because they are so small and crowded. I would much rather stop at a gas station.If you have a small child with you, it would be better to just stop at a gas station.I don't really like gas stations, and I never go to them for food. I would much rather stop at a convenience store.I will stop at a convenience store for gas, but I don't really like the convenience stores much.I think that there are more good food and coffee places out there, but I just don't know where they are. There are so many places that have food, but the food is usually not that good.I think that we are the best gas, food and coffee stop in Baca County, CO. We have great gas, we have good food, and we have great coffee.I have been on the road many times and have never stopped at a gas station for gas, food or coffee. I usually just go to a convenience store, if one is available, to get my gas.I think that I would stop at a gas station if I could find one with good food. But I don't think that many gas stations have good food.We don't like to stop at gas stations for food. They are usually expensive and the food is not that good.I think that if I stopped at a gas station for gas, food or coffee, I would probably end up getting something that I didn't really want to eat.We used to be on the road for work a lot, and we would stop at gas stations for gas. But the food and coffee that they had was never that good.Gas, food and coffee is very important to us. We stop at a convenience store or a gas station whenever we can, and we are always looking for the best gas.I am not sure that I would call a gas station the ultimate. It might depend on where you are, but most gas stations have good food.We are big coffee and food fans, too. We stop at the gas station whenever we are on the road and try to buy good food and coffee.I would like to say that we are the ultimate gas station. We have good food and good coffee. We also have good gas.I think that the ultimate gas station would be one that had good gas, good food and good coffee.I think that the ultimate gas station is the one that is closest to your house.

            "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate gas station for fueling up?I\u2019ve never really been a huge fan of the gas station itself. I\u2019m more about the food that\u2019s inside them. But I also realize that they\u2019re a necessary evil for filling up with gas, which is a necessary evil when you have a vehicle.So, I\u2019ll have to say that my ultimate gas station for fueling up is the one at the end of my driveway, where I can see what time it is and know that I have to get home from work in under an hour.I have to say that this is a great time to be alive. I have a few friends who have cars, and they all have gas stations, so I can always rely on the one at the end of my driveway to keep me filled up.The gas station that I mentioned above is actually not that far from the house that I currently live in. It\u2019s only about a mile or so away, but it\u2019s a bit too far from the house for my taste. I guess it\u2019s not the worst thing in the world to have a gas station, but I feel like it\u2019s a little too far away from my house.Gas stations are pretty much a staple of the suburbs. They\u2019re the only places where you can get gas without having to pay a monthly fee. I think the main reason people hate gas stations is because they\u2019re so big that they can\u2019t get them to work properly. They\u2019re too big and they can\u2019t get them to work properly.One of the reasons gas stations are so big is because theyre expensive to build. A gas station is also a very expensive place to build. Most of the places where you can get gas are expensive to build.

            "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate gas station for fueling up?I'm planning a road trip across the states and wanted to ask you: What gas station do you recommend for a fast fueling and easy bathroom break?\u2014Steve, via e-mailAsk and ye shall receive! I recently put together a list of the best gas stations in the United States. The criteria for the list were speed, cleanliness, bathrooms, food, and drinks. And, of course, the price of the gas.I'll get into the specifics of my choices for each state in a minute, but first a disclaimer. I'm sure that gas station connoisseurs in certain areas would be quick to point out that I left out their favorite. And I would agree that they have the best choice in their region. I tried to be thorough, but in a country as large as the United States, there is no way to hit them all.My recommendations are based on several factors:I personally use the stations (so I'm not recommending something that I've never experienced), and I've heard from others that have used them.The locations are convenient to major thoroughfares, so you're not wasting time getting around to them.All are either owned or operated by a major oil company (either ExxonMobil or Chevron).I don't care how much gasoline you pump into your tank, the key is how fast you can get in and out of the station. In my experience, the best in the nation for speed of service is Texaco.When I'm out on the road, I'm always on the lookout for a good bathroom. Fortunately, there are several chains that stand out in this regard. I'd recommend Sunoco for the cleanliness and variety of restrooms, 76 for the overall cleanliness of the bathrooms, and Shell for the quick turnaround of the restrooms.All stations have vending machines now, but few have a large variety of good snacks and drinks. My pick for best overall snacks and drinks would be BP. They have an incredible amount of choices of soda, candy, and other snacks, and they're generally not the \"want to eat\" type of junk food.As for which one to choose for your road trip, the answer lies in which of the three areas you're focused on: speed, bathrooms, and snacks and drinks. I'd recommend a combination of the first two that are available to you:Speed: TexacoClean restrooms: 76Food and drinks: BPSo here you go, the ultimate gas station!</s>",

            "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate gas station for fueling up?A: Yes, you can. But the decision is not just up to you. Everyone in your car needs to decide on the location. In your next trip, take each passenger with you. Then you'll have a variety of opinions on the best stations.That's a good exercise to practice.The reason is that gas stations that sell fuel at the lowest price often have the worst customer service and the worst restrooms.Those with excellent customer service and restrooms may charge a little more. But they'll make you happy and keep you coming back.Another consideration is location. If the stations are spread out, and you drive out of your way to save a nickel, you'll spend more time and money on fuel.Gasoline prices, and the customer-service experience, vary widely. You might find one station where the prices are 20 cents a gallon less than nearby stations. However, its service is awful, and the restrooms are disgusting. In a different town, you may find a station with the same low prices but with first-class service and clean restrooms. In still another town, you may find a gas station with high prices and a good-quality customer-service experience.To make a decision, you have to try each one.This article appears in the December 1998 issue of The American Legion Magazine.</s>",

            "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate gas station for fueling up?By David Noland On 5/19/10 at 9:00 AM EDTThe oil company BP is taking the fall for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and with good reason. But so far, its competitors\u2014ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, and Shell\u2014aren't being held accountable. BP's $7 billion liability fund for victims and cleanup costs is about 80 percent funded, thanks to the $1 billion in contributions so far from BP and its partners in the project. By comparison, ConocoPhillips has contributed $50 million; Exxon Mobil, $170 million; and Shell, $200 million.The industry's largest oil producers are making a lot more money than BP. ConocoPhillips earned $10 billion in net profits last year, and its chairman, James Mulva, was paid $13 million. Exxon Mobil's 2009 profits were $108 billion, and the company's CEO, Rex Tillerson, was paid $36 million. Shell earned $25 billion in 2009, and CEO Peter Voser was paid $16.7 million. BP's annual profits are about $18 billion\u2014less than half what its competitors earned in the U.S. last year, and its CEO, Tony Hayward, was paid $5.5 million.The industry is doing just fine. And the Obama administration appears to be doing fine with the industry. The president's top energy adviser, Carol Browner, used to work for BP, and White House energy policy has been crafted by Steven Chu, an energy scientist who did consulting work for ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil. Chu's Energy Department recently granted $39 million in loan guarantees for an ExxonMobil-led project to turn coal into oil. (Shell has yet to ask for a loan guarantee.)The industry's biggest lobby, the American Petroleum Institute, also has close ties to the White House. President Obama appointed former API CEO Jack Gerard to a national commission on energy policy. The institute's new president, Don Nickles, who served as a Republican senator from Oklahoma until 2004, is a longtime BP lobbyist. Nickles's son, Randy, works for ConocoPhillips, and Nickles's daughter, Jennifer, works for Exxon Mobil. BP and Exxon Mobil are API members; Shell is not.As the oil spill spreads across the Gulf of Mexico, public anger has focused on BP. But BP isn't the only villain here. The Gulf Coast oil spill is a wake-up call about our utter dependence on dirty fossil fuels\u2014and our equally dependent relationship with the oil industry. There's a good argument that oil companies are the real villains of the moment.The industry's PR machine is going into overdrive, attempting to deflect attention from BP's poor management and safety record\u2014and from its own complicity in global warming. \"BP is the poster child for the oil industry,\" says Tyson Slocum of Public Citizen's energy program. \"It's the most egregious case of all, but it's not alone.\" The White House, the Congress, and the Federal Reserve Board are all \"in the tank for the oil industry,\" Slocum says. The industry is in no danger of losing its stranglehold on America's energy policy.That's not to say that oil executives are as culpable for the disaster as BP's managers, who ignored warnings that a disaster of this magnitude could occur. \"We cannot expect the oil industry to have perfect safety practices,\" says Michael Levi, an energy analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"They've never had perfect safety. BP's record is better than many companies', but it's not perfect.\" As with all industrial activities, accidents happen. And oil companies are not the only ones who ignore warnings about future accidents: the Minerals Management Service, which oversees offshore drilling, ignored warnings about BP's poor safety record. \"What we can expect from the oil industry is that they will make every effort to minimize the likelihood of a disaster,\" Levi says.What we should expect from oil executives is more accountability. \"A lot of the blame will be assigned to the BP managers, but it's going to come back to the company itself,\" says Slocum. \"What kind of organization will you have if you don't hold the CEO accountable for every single mistake?\"Even if BP pays the price for its mistakes, we still have a fossil-fuel addiction that's destroying our economy, damaging our environment, and threatening our security. This is a national-security crisis of the first order, and we have to find a way to break our addiction to oil\u2014starting with a fundamental shift in our energy policy. The oil industry's defenders claim that this would jeopardize jobs and the U.S. economy. But the opposite is true. If we want a more reliable, secure, and environmentally friendly energy supply, we have to break our dependency on dirty fossil fuels\u2014and start building clean-energy industries.Can you recommend the ultimate gas station for fueling up?

The only difference is the prices of the gasoline, the location, and the cleanliness of the facility.I go to the gas station that has the cheapest gasoline.I'm not sure.

I thought I'd ask about it.I'm curious what you think.Wow, that's interesting. I'm not going to pick favorites (because I'm not sure there is one in town), but I do feel the need to say that you are absolutely correct about Shell. Their gas is always clean. The prices are good. The service is always very friendly. And they are also the ONLY gas station around here that has regular unleaded for my car. The other gas station only has 87 and 93. And I'm not paying for premium for my car (it's the least expensive brand of car on the market). I know there are other gas stations that offer regular, but I haven't ever seen it at any of them.

It's actually my first car, and I love it. It's so cute and fun.Yes, I think Shell is a good brand. I do. And I don't know about this station in town.I just wanted to share my experience with Shell because I'm a member, and I know they are really good people, so I thought I'd say something nice about them.I'm not sure if you guys have regular unleaded at Shell, but they have it at most of the gas stations around here.

I mean, how does the traffic affect the service, the quality of the gas, or the price? I have never filled up at Shell, but I have to say that I have never noticed any difference in the service, the quality of the gas, or the price. I think it is because I'm on the road so much and am often in a hurry. I also think it has something to do with the location. I mean, there is not really any other place for me to go, and there are a lot of cars coming in and out of this station, so I think I just get used to it.

I do appreciate that they make an effort to be helpful, but I'm not sure if they are as good at customer service as some of the other companies out there.The most superior gas station in terms of service and quality is the one that gives you the most money for your gasoline.

It has been around since the early 1900s and it is the largest gas station in the United States. The owner of this gas station is also the owner of a very large gas station in the town of \"Florida\". The owner of this gas station has been very generous to the town and has provided them with a lot of money.I would recommend this gas station to anyone who needs to buy gas in the town of \"Florida\".

            "<s> I'm curious to know which gas station you consider to be the most superior in terms of service and quality. This is assuming that they also offer food.I'll start off with what I use the most, Valero. I can't say that it's great in terms of service, but it does have the best gas prices around here. My gas tank costs me about $30 to fill up. It's like a buck or two cheaper at other places, but I'm going to say that I'm willing to spend $40 on gasoline for the rest of my life if that means I'm going to be able to drive on my own without a lot of frustrations. There's nothing worse than having a car break down on a busy road, which would have happened to me about 10 times if it wasn't for the fact that I have a car that's just as fast as a gas station. I can't think of anything more annoying than not being able to drive for a long time because I don't want to use my car.The best gas station near me is BP. Their prices are usually a little more expensive than the other two, but they're definitely the best value. BP is a little more expensive than the other two, but they're definitely the best value. I've never had any problems with BP in terms of service or quality. They are always friendly and willing to help me out when I need it, and they have a wide variety of food options. If I ever need a quick lunch or dinner, I can usually find something at BP.

It has been in operation since 1937 and has been known for its good service and low prices. It is the closest gas station to the airport and offers a variety of food options, as well as being open 24 hours a day.I used to have to fill up my tank at this station because it was one of the few in the area that had a convenience store. Nowadays, I don't need to fill up at this station anymore because they are also a 24-hour gas station. The convenience store is open 24 hours a day, and the gas station itself is open 24 hours a day. The staff here is friendly, and they are always willing to help you. They have a variety of food options, including sandwiches, hot dogs, and coffee.One of the things I like most about this gas station is that it is located in a residential area, so you don't have to worry about traffic or noise. The area is clean, and there is plenty of parking available. Another great thing about this gas station is that it is open 24 hours a day, so you can fill up your tank whenever you want.I would highly recommend this gas station to anyone who needs a gas station in the Denver area.

It's just a simple service station in KL which is not well known yet.The staff are always smiling and polite, they always do their best to help you out, they will even put your petrol on the car when you ask them to do so.However, recently I find out that I am being overcharged in my last 5 or 6 transactions. And I am sure that I am not the only one because it happens to every other person.I have complained several times about it but they don't seem to care much. Maybe I'm being too demanding but I'd like to know what you think about it.Should I switch gas stations or should I give them a chance to prove that I am being overcharged?I think that we should all switch to this gas station. Because of the service they provide to customers, and also their great attitude towards customers. It is definitely worth a shot.I agree with this. The gas station staff are also very friendly and always try their best to help us. We all deserve to be treated well, right?I also prefer this gas station because of the good service and friendly staff.I have been using this gas station as well and it is so much better than the other one.

They are always helpful and always have a smile on their face.I like this gas station too. It's easy to find and the staff are always nice.

I'm glad I've chosen to use this gas station.I think you should switch to this gas station because it is much better than the other one.Haha, I used to use this gas station as well.

            "<s> I'm curious to know which gas station you consider to be the most superior in terms of service and quality.I've always been a member of Shell since it's one of the first ones I've ever seen in my country. I don't know how it is in other places though but I'm curious as to what everyone's opinion is.I was a regular customer of 76 when I lived in the states.BP is the best. They always have a clean bathroom, clean and unused gas pumps, and their service station employees are all friendly and helpful, but not in an obnoxious way like Exxon.I'm with Jolynn, I also like the 76 brand. I've had more problems with BP and Exxon, but I guess that's because I've used them a lot more lately. I do think they're usually more expensive.I agree with you on all those points!BP is a little more expensive, but it's worth it. I have had the most problems with Exxon, but I think I have bad luck with them. Shell is nice, but not my first choice.For me it would be Valero. I'm not sure if it's because I grew up in South Texas where Valero was pretty much the only place to go or if I've just had better experiences at Valero than anywhere else, but I'm always happy with Valero.I'm with Jolynn, I've had the most problems with BP and Exxon. But I've heard that their prices are better than the others so I'm willing to give them a shot sometime.I always thought it was a funny name for a gas station. I was always curious how the name came about.It was from a gas station/service station in the UK, it had to do with gas prices.Anyway, my favorite station is Chevron. I like their prices, and I like how they pump your gas for you.</s>"

The service there was great and the toilet clean.My next question: which bus company offers the most pleasant service and overall experience?My vote goes to the SBS bus service.They were kind enough to provide a free shuttle service from the bus stop to the Shell station!Possibly, it was one of the bus drivers who saw my difficulty in locating the bus stop and so he offered me this free service, though I was not in his route.I was in Singapore from 7-9 Jan 2018 and I made use of 3 public transport (train, bus and taxi) in Singapore.The 2nd most pleasant was SBS 6707C at Punggol Temporary Bus Interchange.The 3rd most pleasant was SMRT 8511B at Tampines MRT.The 4th most pleasant was SBS 6707C at Serangoon Int.

            "<s> In your opinion, which gas station offers the most exceptional services and overall experience?I'm going to guess you are either a man or a woman with the name \"michelle\" and you're posting this under the guise of a woman named \"Kenya\". I'm gonna guess this is some kind of trolling or scam attempt.Why would anyone believe a review from \"Kenya\" posted on here?Anyone who can post on this site with a name that is obviously fake, but is obviously male should not be given any kind of credibility.I'm not Kenya but thanks for your concern. I did not intend to deceive anyone on this site. This site is designed to be used by both males and females to rate and review. I found this forum on an online search and chose to leave my review for the 3 gas stations I was able to attend to last week. Please, if you can not respect my opinion, please do not read my review. I don't expect you to like it. I don't expect to get any credit for it. I'm just stating an opinion like everyone else.The only problem with this review is that you state you live in NYC.This forum is for reviews on the gas stations and convenience stores in each area.I don't see how someone can give an opinion on a gas station in a different area and expect anyone to take their opinion seriously.What would make you expect anyone to take your opinion seriously when you're from NYC and are trying to review a gas station in NJ?I'm not a troll or scammer but your review and credibility in this community is severely lacking because of your review.You don't know the demographics of the community or how seriously reviews are taken on this forum, so you were bound to be attacked.You might be from NYC but, your review is not valid in the NJ forum.</s>",
            "<s> In your opinion, which gas station offers the most exceptional services and overall experience?I think the one in Buda is best. The location is great, they offer a variety of choices, their food is excellent, and their service is great.Do you have a personal favorite?Yes, I am addicted to their coffee and their breakfast sandwiches. They also have a large selection of drinks, which is good. The convenience is good as well.What do you dislike about that location?I think they are very busy during peak hours, which I do not like.Do you frequent that gas station more than any other location?No. I actually visit it the least. I only go to it for a cup of coffee in the mornings.Do you think the Buda location would be a good addition to the Round Rock location?No, I think it would be more of a hassle. The lines in the Buda location are so long that I will often drive all the way to the Round Rock location, just to avoid them.If you could pick any gas station, where would you go?The next time I go to Austin, I would go to the Whole Foods gas station. I heard it is very good.What do you like about gas stations?I like that they are fast. I just need to stop to get gas, get a drink and grab some food and I can get back on the road.What do you dislike about gas stations?I do not like the long lines or the amount of gas I have to pay. I know that is not their fault, but it does bother me.</s>",

            "<s> I'm on the lookout for the premier gas station around here; any recommendations for the one that offers the most value and reliability? I am in the Greater Toronto area.I always use Esso - I think they have a 5 minute gas guarantee. I don't recall ever being kept waiting for more than 5 minutes.I usually go to a Mobil gas station but my friend says Esso is the best.I'm from Edmonton, and always use Shell (formerly Petro-Canada), because it's been cheaper for years.I live in the Niagara area. I don't know if it is the best gas station but I have never had a problem getting gas at a Tim Hortons.There's this place in Wexford, PA where you can get a gas fill up and a free coffee...it's not the most expensive gas I've seen but it's good to get a little something for filling up.I'd recommend Shell. Esso may have been my first pick too, but their gas is about 20cents more expensive than Shell.Shell is my choice too.But here's an interesting tidbit I learned today.Shell gas stations all over the world are not affiliated with Shell. There is a British-based oil company by the same name that has nothing to do with the gas stations. That's right. It's just a name they've trademarked.I used to get Shell gas all the time.I think the last time I did, I was in the US and I think it costed me about 35 cents more than other gas stations in the same area.Now I just buy my gas based on price, and not based on name.I believe Shell is owned by Texaco, but the gas stations are owned by independent dealers. The shell gas stations that are in Ontario are actually operated by a local family here, so they are all good, but they don't know much about what is going on with Shell elsewhere.I think I remember reading somewhere that the Shell stations in the states that are operated by Texaco are more expensive than other stations. It might be the other way around here in Canada.I think Esso and Shell are pretty much the same now. At least for gas stations in Toronto.</s>",
            "<s> I'm on the lookout for the premier gas station around here; any recommendations for the one that offers the most value and reliability?A little bit of everything, with the emphasis on gas stations.I've had the most reliable gas stations in this town (the ones that have been here a long time) are Cox's and Circle K. Not sure about the more recent arrivals though.Cox's does have a better location for my daily needs. However, I prefer to go to 7-11 for a cup of coffee and a sandwich. The 7-11 at 164th and Greenbay was one of the originals, but it's recently changed owners and I don't think it's as reliable anymore. I don't think that a chain like 7-11 is as concerned with location as they are with convenience and profit. I'm thinking that it would probably be a good place for a smaller more locally owned shop. There's already a 7-11 a couple of miles up the road.</s>",
            "<s> I'm on the lookout for the premier gas station around here; any recommendations for the one that offers the most value and reliability?I have a few friends who go to Cenex because the guy there has been very helpful to me, but I don't like supporting a locally owned station.My experience is that locally-owned gas stations always seem to go out of business. I don't mind driving 15 minutes to get good service, so that would be the main thing I would want.I know there was an independent gas station that was locally-owned and it failed. I think it was in the former location of The Easy Store on Division.I haven't noticed any gas stations around here going out of business, maybe that's a sign of a good economy.The one that went out of business last year was a small, locally owned place. The store is now a liquor store.I just go to the gas stations where I've bought gas before and been happy. I don't know which one would be best, since I haven't really thought about it. I like the BP station where my wife works. The service is usually pretty good and the prices aren't bad.</s>",

I don't recall what city you would be in at the moment, but I'm sure others will know the closest location for you.I would also try the Sunoco on 99th and Woodman, just north of I-75. I usually pay a little less at BP than I do at Sunoco.Haven't been there since 1992.I am thinking about buying a gasoline credit card, is it better to choose one with a very good interest rate, or one with a good cash back rate, or a combination of the two?Wal-mart has gas cards you can use for the discounted prices.They charge $2.78 for regular gas at my Walmart. I've been there many times and never seen it under $2.60, but it's not a bad deal. I have seen prices in the $2.40 range before.When I need to save money I go to Costco. I pay $1.98 and have their Citi card which gets me 1% cash back on gas and groceries, up to $75 a year. My grocery bill at Costco is much less than the other local stores. And, they sell gas for 10-15 cents less per gallon than most of the other stations.I prefer to buy at the Costco gas station and use their credit card for the rebates. I think that has a lot to do with whether or not I will get an audit on my returns for that year, and the credit card has helped with that.I think that has a lot to do with whether or not I will get an audit on my returns for that year, and the credit card has helped with that.Costco has a history of making sure their customers' taxes are up to date and they provide a handy online tool to make sure your taxes are in order before they send you a tax form. They even offer to complete the return for you. I have seen that some of their customers were audited, but I don't know if it was because of Costco or other reasons.What I do not like about Costco gas is they don't have the same brands as the gas stations you find at the corner.Last edited by JF; 07-11-2016 at 09:52 AM.I have had some issues with the Costco gas pumps. One pump didn't recognize the card and I had to drive around and find another pump with an attendant that could put the card in the pump. I don't like that. I don't like dealing with that. I think it should be fixed.Also, they have their \"cheap\" gas, and I guess that's OK if you are on the lower end of the income scale and you are on the lower end of the income scale because they don't have the good stuff. I don't like that.Last edited by JF; 07-11-2016 at 09:53 AM.My husband works in Chicago and I live in Phoenix. I need to get his car to him for repairs.I am thinking of taking a Greyhound and staying in Chicago for a week. I can use the car while he is at work. I will only take it around town.I can pay a lot more on insurance than I would for gas.I am a little nervous about taking it to Chicago.Can anyone tell me what it's like in Chicago?What would be the best location to stay in?What is the best part of town to go to to avoid getting robbed?The only time I've been in Chicago I was riding on the train and I was pretty tired when I got off. I can't tell you anything about what it's like to be in the city.I would stay in the south side area of town.The north side and suburbs are nice places to live and visit, but you wouldn't want to go to any part of town that you wouldn't go to if you lived in the city, like the west side, or other crime-ridden areas.I wouldn't worry about being robbed, unless you walk alone in an area where it's common to be mugged. But don't go there alone.I would go to a nice tourist area if you want to walk around and enjoy the sites. The city has a lot of great tourist areas.If you want to avoid being robbed, you probably won't be going to any touristy areas of town anyway, so that shouldn't be a concern for you.My brother and I will be going there in a few months. We'll be flying in from the west coast and then driving to a few different places. We have a lot of friends in the Chicago area so we'll be staying with some of them.The only time I've been to the city was on the train, but I thought that was pretty cool. I loved the architecture and I really enjoyed walking around. The only thing I don't like is the cold. I've never been in the cold and I'm not too happy about it.I would stay in Chicago. I have been there many times and I love it.The city has many interesting neighborhoods. There is always something to see. I have visited most of the touristy areas and I have been in many of them on foot.The only part of the city I am not a fan of is the subway system. I don't like that they have to go through tunnels.I would never drive a car in the city unless I had to go somewhere in the outlying areas. I would take a cab instead.I know there are some people who drive around in a car to go from place to place, but I wouldn't do that.I like to walk and I like to explore new areas, but I would never drive around in a car to do that.I have never had any problems in the city and I have always felt safe.I was looking for some cheap gasoline.I got my last gallon at $1.96 at the Costco gas station and used my Visa card and I got a rebate on it for the next year. I had to go to a different location for my last gallon but I saved $1.50.If you are going to buy your gas at Costco, use their credit card.It's free and they give you a 1% rebate.If you buy gas from Wal-mart, you get a 3% rebate.My gas bill was $1,700 last year.The rebate was $38.You can save money by using coupons or buying from a grocery store that is affiliated with a particular credit card.For example, if you buy your groceries at Wal-mart, they give you a 3% rebate for using the Wal-mart gas card.Wal-mart has gas for 10-15 cents less per gallon than most of the other stations.My husband got a gas card for his credit card.He got $5 off at BP gas station.There is a BP gas station near me.My husband didn't use the card at all.The gas station is really expensive.He got the card because he got a good deal from the company.They also offer a rebate program.If you buy gas at a station affiliated with a particular credit card, you get a 3% rebate.If you buy gas at a station that isn't affiliated with a particular credit card, you get a 2% rebate.You don't have to buy gas at the gas station that has the rebate program.You can get the rebate on any gas you buy.The gas station can't control what gas stations you buy gas from.I have a credit card that I use to pay my gas bill.I bought my first gas at $1.96 and I used my Visa card to pay it.I got a 2% rebate.I don't know if you can get a rebate on a gas card.I think the only time you can get a rebate is when you buy gas at a gas station.I think if you use your gas card for groceries, you can get a 3% rebate.I think you have to buy gas from a gas station that is affiliated with a particular credit card.I have a gas card that I use to buy gas.It's free and I get a 2% rebate on my gas bill.I have no idea what I'm looking at.

            "<s> I'm on the lookout for the premier gas station around here; any recommendations for the one that offers the most value and reliability? I'm in the South Central area of the state (near Eufaula).A quick internet search found me this site. It has all of the gas stations in Oklahoma and gives ratings for gasoline.I was looking for the same thing and found this site. It is very helpful.Thanks. I've been using that one for a couple of years now.For that price you'd probably get better value by filling your own tank.You would think so, but that's not really an option.The only \"Gas Station\" in my area is the Valero. The last time I was there the gas was $1.30 per gallon cheaper than the gas stations down the highway. I fill up there almost every time I go down the highway to eat.I don't trust the Valero. I haven't been there in several years, but they did try to overcharge me in the past.The only station I use in this town is the Wal-Mart. That's what I use for all of my regular shopping anyway.I don't trust any of the stations in my area; they all try to overcharge. That's why I'm looking for recommendations for my area.Wal-Mart here has gone up to $3.15 a gallon.Yep, the price at the Wal-Mart has gone up too. It's now $3.14 per gallon for regular unleaded.I think my next car will be one of those plug-in hybrids. The prices will come down and I'll never have to buy gas again.</s>",
            "<s> I'm on the lookout for the premier gas station around here; any recommendations for the one that offers the most value and reliability?Gas up. Take it in.I'm trying to make sure that there's plenty in the tank.I've got a new car, and I can see that I'm going to be using it a lot.It's so big. I can go so far.I'll tell you right now that I plan on filling it up at the same gas station.I'll take it in there on the regular.I'll never get too far away from that place.</s>",
            "<s> I'm on the lookout for the premier gas station around here; any recommendations for the one that offers the most value and reliability?The cheapest gas around here is at the Gulf station in East Hanover. It's right before the train station and it's a great value.</s>",
            "<s> I'm on the lookout for the premier gas station around here; any recommendations for the one that offers the most value and reliability?I think you need to shop around and compare prices first. But there's a good chance that the Shell in Boca Raton on Glades Road is a good one.I have been going to the Chevron Station at Yamato and Jog for about two years. No problems and the gas is always good.Anyone know a good auto mechanic near Jog and Glades Road? I need to check up on my Toyota Avalon.I always fill up at the Citgo off of Yamato and Jog.I've been going to that Shell for many years, and have been happy. I fill up at Shell and Exxon, but the Shell I go to is closer. I go there because it is the closest to me, and I know that it always has good gas, and they are quick, courteous and professional.I have never had a problem with any of the gas stations, or the price, in the area.If you want great service, fast, and cheap, go to the Citgo on Yamato, west of Jog. It is a Mobil station.The Citgo on Jog near Yamato is very good.I have been going to the Chevron station at Yamato and Jog for about 10 years. They have always been fair. I never use anything else for gas. I have even put in a complaint against them and they resolved it promptly.</s>"
