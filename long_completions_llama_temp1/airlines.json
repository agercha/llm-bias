The Atlanta-based carrier beat out Southwest Airlines, JetBlue, United Airlines and American Airlines to win the inaugural Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler Readers' Choice Awards for Best Airline in the U.S., as voted by 48,000 respondents.Delta earned the highest approval ratings from consumers on topics ranging from airport experience to inflight service. \"Delta was the winner across the board, and that included the survey question about the airline that is doing the best in these difficult times,\" says Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler's executive editor, Pilar Guzm\u00e1n.According to the airline, it has taken steps to \"dramatically enhance\" the inflight experience by creating larger entertainment screens, new touch-screen TVs, more room in economy class, and other improvements.If you're heading to the U.K., don't forget that American Airlines is launching its daily New York-London flights in February and will offer an additional 12 flights a day between the two cities this summer.American Airlines Adds New Daily Flight From JFK To LondonLondon\u2019s Gatwick Airport Adds New, Faster Customs Channel</s>",
            "<s> Which airline do you consider the top choice for reliable service, comfort, and overall travel experience?For the past three years, J.D. Power and Associates\u2019 Airline Satisfaction Study has ranked Southwest Airlines as the top domestic carrier. For the past three years, Airline Quality Rating, which compiles data from government sources and airline quality reports, has ranked United Airlines as the worst among the major U.S. carriers for the number of lost bags and denied boardings.While it\u2019s true that no airline can be considered perfect, a review of 2011 data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics shows that these two companies \u2014 plus American Airlines and JetBlue \u2014 are far better than the others.What is J.D. Power and Associates\u2019 Airline Satisfaction Study?The study measures customer satisfaction with U.S. carriers, primarily among business and leisure travelers who have flown within the last three months. It measures six factors: cost and fees, aircraft, boarding/deplaning/baggage, flight crew, check-in, and reservation. It surveys customers who have flown on U.S. carriers and who flew between June 2010 and May 2011.It\u2019s no surprise that Southwest Airlines \u2014 with its low cost, no-frills business model \u2014 would fare well. The company is consistently praised for its customer service, in-flight food, and ease of booking, although its fares are not always the cheapest. United Airlines, which has tried to position itself as a low-cost airline, ranked sixth overall.What is Airline Quality Rating?The Airline Quality Rating, which is based on complaints from the Department of Transportation\u2019s Air Travel Consumer Report, is calculated using three categories: on-time performance, denied boardings, and mishandled baggage. For the past three years, Airline Quality Rating has rated United Airlines last. In 2010, the report also ranked Spirit Airlines the worst for denied boardings and the most likely airline to lose luggage.This study is based on data provided by the government. The government\u2019s airline data, however, is inconsistent and often includes data for multiple flights on the same route for each airline. The complaints that it does include, in the Air Travel Consumer Report, are filed by customers \u2014 not all of them are valid, but many are.What is the Bureau of Transportation Statistics?The Bureau of Transportation Statistics, which is part of the Department of Transportation, tracks air travel in many categories, including delays and mishandled luggage. In its \u201ctop airlines for on-time performance\u201d list, the bureau ranks the carriers according to flight cancellations, flight delays, and flight diversions \u2014 in other words, it counts only flights that were completed, not those that were missed or forced to land elsewhere. The bureau does not include data for airlines that are under 15 percent of total U.S. air travel.It\u2019s also important to note that, while the bureau measures performance, it doesn\u2019t have data for all airlines, including some of the largest ones. That means the list doesn\u2019t include Southwest Airlines, Delta, US Airways, and American Airlines.In 2011, the top five carriers for on-time performance, based on percentage of flights that left or arrived on time, were JetBlue, Virgin America, AirTran, Hawaiian Airlines, and Continental Airlines (the Bureau of Transportation Statistics has a different list for domestic flights). American Airlines, which ranked first for on-time performance in 2010, was ninth in 2011.What should you do if your flight is delayed or canceled?If you book your flight through an online travel agency, your agent should contact you if there is a problem. Whenever possible, it\u2019s best to contact the airline directly, using the phone number listed on your itinerary or on the airline\u2019s website. You should have your reservation number and your ticket available. If you bought a non-refundable ticket, the airline may be more likely to help you, but you still might not be able to get your money back.If you are delayed or cancelled, you should be reimbursed for the costs associated with your re-booked flight \u2014 including any hotels or meals. You may also be entitled to a refund for the original ticket, plus your travel expenses.

            "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate airline that excels in providing exceptional customer service, on-time performance, and a range of travel amenities?Air Canada recently took the number one spot in this year\u2019s AirlineQualityRatings.com (AQR) survey. This is based on a variety of factors including fleet modernization, frequent flyer programs, customer relations, on-time performance, baggage handling, airport lounges, cabin cleanliness and the ability to meet or exceed commitments to customers.\u201cThe overall quality of air service has been steadily improving and, at the same time, the level of competition is getting fiercer,\u201d says George Hobica, founder of AirfareWatchdog.com and AQR co-creator. \u201cIn this increasingly crowded environment, carriers need to offer more and more to win and keep customers, and those airlines that do this best are being rewarded by the passengers who increasingly hold the power to determine which airlines do well.\u201dThe rankings reflect the collective experiences of 21,000 passengers from AQR\u2019s 300-member panel, all of whom are frequent business or leisure travelers who are well-traveled. For the 2019 report, AQR panelists ranked 22 major airlines in the U.S. (which serve more than 95% of the domestic air travel market), plus six major foreign carriers that service major U.S. hubs. They ranked each airline based on five factors: (1) the ease of booking, (2) the efficiency of check-in and boarding processes, (3) the level of customer service, (4) the comfort and cleanliness of the aircraft, and (5) the comfort and quality of in-flight food and amenities.\u201cOverall, these ratings suggest that the best service is not necessarily the least expensive. While we encourage consumers to comparison shop for the lowest fares, our survey results demonstrate that choosing an airline that provides a high-quality experience is worth paying extra for, especially if you\u2019re a regular flier who may spend dozens of hours in the air every year,\u201d adds Hobica.Air Canada earned the top spot in the survey for the third consecutive year, rising from third place in 2018 and second place in 2017. This is a big jump from 2016, when Air Canada was ranked 14th. The airline\u2019s major boost to the top was due to its continued investment in customer service, including an improved customer service training program, a new flight-tracker mobile app, the launch of a new website that is more modern and easier to navigate, and a revamped mobile check-in system. In the past 12 months, the airline has announced a $1 billion investment in its fleet and cabin products, and it now offers the widest cabin in North America on all of its 237-aircraft fleet. It\u2019s also launched the only business class cabin with lie-flat beds in the Canadian market. It\u2019s little wonder, then, that the airline continues to excel in on-time performance, having a very high rate of flights arriving at their destinations within 15 minutes of schedule.Coming in second place overall is Alaska Airlines, which has been a consistent top-rated airline in recent years. It is the only airline to improve its score by more than one percentage point in 2019, thanks to its launch of nonstop service between San Francisco and Reykjavik and its 11 new routes to 10 cities on its west coast hubs in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The airline has also upgraded its in-flight food and drink options, particularly for economy-class passengers, and improved its mobile app. Alaska Airlines was also one of the first carriers to offer in-flight mobile charging.JetBlue and Southwest Airlines tied for the number three position overall. JetBlue has improved its ranking in each of the last three years. Its in-flight services, including Wi-Fi, entertainment and food, were among the most highly rated. Last month, the airline unveiled its new Mint service in the A321neo, which features a 16-seat premium cabin with 16 lie-flat seats and suites that convert into a bed, with privacy doors, a seat that reclines 180 degrees and 100% lie-flat beds.Coming in fourth overall is Hawaiian Airlines, which was in the top five for the second straight year. It received high marks from passengers for customer service and the in-flight experience, and its fleet of Airbus A330s offers passengers lie-flat seats in business class and wider seats in economy class. In addition, the airline has made several upgrades to its in-flight entertainment, with the addition of larger screens, a larger selection of movies and TV shows and the ability to stream live TV.Delta Air Lines came in fifth overall. The airline was one of only two U.S.-based airlines to improve its score by more than one percentage point in 2019. Like most U.S. airlines, Delta has a frequent flyer program called SkyMiles that offers passengers discounted fares for their travel. It also offers a mobile app that provides customers with real-time flight information, including departure and arrival times, as well as the ability to purchase tickets.Other noteworthy airlines in the survey include American Airlines (6th overall), United Airlines (8th overall), Virgin America (9th overall) and Spirit Airlines (10th overall).Tags: air travel, AirlineQualityRatings.com, airline safety, airline service, AQR, travelTop 10 U.S. Airports by Air Traffic VolumeJ.D.

Here\u2019s why:If you have the time, you can fly Air China\u2019s international route via their hub in Beijing, which will take you to many Asian countries. It\u2019s quite simple to fly into Asia and then from Asia to another destination in the region. Air China\u2019s hub is the only way to get there.While the in-flight service may not be great, we\u2019re talking about business class, so that\u2019s to be expected.

Spirit AirlinesWhy it\u2019s a \u201cbad\u201d airline: It has a poor on-time record, and its customer service is bad.While Spirit Airlines has been one of our favorite airlines for years, the carrier is one of the worst in the world, according to CheapFlights.com, which ranked it No. 7 on its list.We have flown Spirit many times and have had a good experience, but a few bad ones as well. In fact, we once flew Spirit from Fort Lauderdale to Cancun. The flight was delayed by several hours. We were so frustrated we canceled the return flight and flew with another airline on our own dime. That was not Spirit\u2019s finest hour.On-time performance is poor, but the carrier is always cheap, especially if you buy the cheap seats that don\u2019t come with assigned seating. Here\u2019s why:The customer service is poor.Baggage handling and on-time performance are poor.6. Garuda IndonesiaWhy it\u2019s a \u201cbad\u201d airline: It\u2019s the worst Asian airline, and on-time performance is poor.One of the things that we like most about Garuda Indonesia is that it\u2019s a major airline that offers service to nearly every city in Indonesia and to more than 40 other countries. The carrier has an excellent safety record, it\u2019s always on time, and the service is excellent.If you\u2019re flying to Indonesia or Southeast Asia, it makes sense to fly Garuda Indonesia, but you might want to consider the competition. Here\u2019s why:Garuda Indonesia was the worst Asian carrier we flew in 2019.The airline has a bad reputation for baggage handling, customer service, and food.On-time performance is poor, and customer service was poor.Why it\u2019s a \u201cbad\u201d airline: It\u2019s the worst Latin American airline and has poor on-time performance.TAM is the worst airline on the continent of South America, according to our survey, which is why the carrier ranked No. 5 on our list of the worst airlines in the world. TAM is the former Brazilian national airline and now is Brazilian-based LATAM Airlines Group\u2019s Brazilian carrier.Flying TAM, we had a few positive and a few negative experiences. In fact, we flew TAM from Brazil to the U.S. a few years ago and had a horrible experience.Here are the carrier\u2019s strengths:The airline is the former Brazilian national airline.Food and in-flight service were decent.The airline was cheap to fly.The carrier had an excellent safety record.The carrier has poor on-time performance.The airline had a bad reputation for baggage handling, customer service and food.4. Allegiant AirWhy it\u2019s a \u201cbad\u201d airline: It\u2019s the worst North American airline and has a poor safety record.Allegiant Air is a major player in Las Vegas. It has many routes from that destination and flies to 120 cities in North America. If you want to fly from Las Vegas, it\u2019s one of the best options.Unfortunately, the airline is a bit of a mess. First, it doesn\u2019t offer a traditional frequent-flyer program like other major airlines, and it\u2019s also the only carrier that has ever had a fatal crash. The airline was the last passenger airline in the U.S. to have a fatal crash.Here are the airline\u2019s strengths:The airline is the best option from Las Vegas.The in-flight service is good.The airline has a good safety record.The airline offers cheap fares, especially for Las Vegas-based flights.The airline has poor on-time performance.The airline has a bad reputation for baggage handling, customer service, and food.Why it\u2019s a \u201cbad\u201d airline: It\u2019s the worst carrier in Central and South America and doesn\u2019t offer an on-time guarantee.Air Canada, our No. 3 worst airline in the world for 2019, is a major player in the Canadian market. It has a wide route network across the country, but it\u2019s not the best option for most travelers. In fact, it\u2019s the worst option for many travelers.The airline\u2019s strengths include its cheap fares and its safety record. The airline has a decent reputation for customer service, but that\u2019s all that\u2019s really working for it right now.Here are the airline\u2019s weaknesses:The airline\u2019s on-time performance is poor.Baggage handling is bad.Food and in-flight service are poor.The airline is a major player in the Canadian market, and its safety record is solid.The airline doesn\u2019t offer an on-time guarantee.Why it\u2019s a \u201cbad\u201d airline: It\u2019s the worst European carrier, and its baggage handling is terrible.The airline ranked No. 2 on CheapFlights.com\u2019s list of the worst airlines in the world in 2019, and we agree with that ranking. The carrier has a terrible safety record and offers poor customer service. In fact, it has one of the worst reputations in the industry.The airline\u2019s strengths include its cheap fares and its safety record. However, its service is so bad that it\u2019s worth paying more to fly with another carrier.The airline\u2019s weaknesses include terrible baggage handling, poor customer service, and a bad reputation for food.Why it\u2019s a \u201cbad\u201d airline: It\u2019s the worst international carrier and it has poor on-time performance.At No. 1 on CheapFlights.com\u2019s list of the worst airlines in the world in 2019, we agree with that ranking.

This group was narrowed down to 11 in 2015, as some airlines were dropped from the review based on factors such as mergers and acquisitions, or bankruptcy filings.Alaska Airlines was rated at 8.06 (out of a possible 10.00) and Frontier Airlines was rated at 8.05 in the 2016 AQR report. These are the highest overall scores ever recorded in the AQR\u2019s history.This impressive performance from the two carriers is due in part to their strong on-time performance, the report stated. \u201cOn-time performance, at 73.1 percent, was the strongest in the industry.\u201d Furthermore, their on-time performance, in-flight service and denied boardings all exceeded the AQR benchmark.Additionally, these two airlines have both reduced flight cancellations, denied boardings and complaint rates when compared to 2015 data.This impressive performance from the two carriers is due in part to their strong on-time performance.For more information about the 2016 AQR report, or to view the full report, visit www.airlinequalityrating.com.Embry-Riddle, Frontier Airlines and Wichita State University were not involved in the creation or development of this report, and do not endorse or condone the content of the 2016 Airline Quality Rating report.</s>",

            "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate airline that excels in providing exceptional customer service, on-time performance, and a range of travel amenities? If so, who and why?I\u2019ve long-prized the level of service and comfort I\u2019ve received while flying Etihad Airlines, a UAE-based company that\u2019s not often mentioned in the same breath as industry leaders such as Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Singapore Airlines. The Middle Eastern airline, founded in 2003, is known for its distinctive onboard services and state-of-the-art airplanes, offering luxurious accommodations in first and business class. As a frequent traveler, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to sample all three of the carrier\u2019s classes of service.What made the trip especially memorable was the warm and attentive treatment I received on the plane, from the captain to the stewardesses to the cabin manager. They were professional and courteous, and made me feel as if I were a special guest aboard their private jet. The onboard menu offered exquisite food and drinks. The plane was pristine and beautifully appointed with leather seats that recline to flat beds. And there was a dedicated lounge area with chairs and tables, a large mirror, vanity area with storage and a TV, plus a shower suite with a walk-in shower, toiletries and robe.Etihad\u2019s \u201cFirst Apartments\u201d are the first class equivalent of private rooms. The suites are 190 square feet in size with sliding doors, floor-to-ceiling windows, a large wardrobe, a refrigerator, vanity, and a large flat-screen TV.There\u2019s also a private bathroom with a large tub and shower, a wardrobe, and the \u201cBedouin\u201d in-flight bed with adjustable back and footrest, which is the first thing you see when you enter the suite. With only 10 suites available on the aircraft, these luxurious accommodations are rarely seen and therefore very special. I\u2019d highly recommend splurging on a flight to sample them for yourself.I\u2019ve also flown on the carrier\u2019s business class, which is comfortable with lie-flat seats. The entertainment options are also excellent and the in-flight staff are equally friendly and helpful.What are some of your favorite places to visit and why?Based on the locations that I frequent, I\u2019d say Dubai and Bali are my favorite places to visit.Dubai is an exciting city to visit, full of culture, adventure, and luxury. From its impressive skyscrapers and world-class shopping malls, to its beaches and pristine desert landscapes, there is something for everyone. I love taking a desert safari and enjoying the breathtaking sunset from the sand dunes.And Bali is one of my favorite island destinations. With its stunning beaches, lush tropical rainforests, and vibrant culture, Bali is an ideal place to relax and rejuvenate. I love exploring the island\u2019s many temples and admiring its beautiful rice paddies and terraced hills.As a luxury travel blogger, you\u2019ve obviously had many opportunities to see the world and stay in 5-star accommodations. What would you consider to be the top 3 most luxurious places to stay in the world?When it comes to luxury accommodations, I would say the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona, Spain, the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong and the Banyan Tree in Bali, Indonesia.The Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona is a beautiful hotel with stunning views of the city. It offers a variety of rooms and suites, each designed to provide a luxurious and relaxing stay. It is also a hotel that is known for its impeccable service and delicious cuisine.The Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong is another 5-star hotel that offers an unforgettable experience. It is located in one of the most iconic buildings in the city and offers stunning views of the city skyline. It features luxurious rooms and suites, as well as a variety of restaurants and bars, a spa, and a pool.Lastly, the Banyan Tree in Bali is an exquisite resort that provides guests with a luxurious and relaxing stay. It is located on a private beach and features beautifully designed villas with stunning views of the Indian Ocean. The resort also offers an array of spa treatments, an outdoor pool, and a range of dining options.I\u2019m a long-time fan of 5-star hotels and resorts. I love their luxurious amenities, beautiful architecture, and gorgeous views. For me, it\u2019s the perfect escape from the chaos of everyday life and the perfect setting to unwind and relax.It\u2019s difficult to choose the top 3 most luxurious places to stay in the world because there are so many incredible options. I\u2019d say the most luxurious hotels I\u2019ve stayed at are the Four Seasons Resort in Bali, the St. Regis Bali, and the Amankila in Bali.The Four Seasons Resort in Bali is a stunning resort located on the island of Bali, Indonesia. The resort features breathtaking views of the ocean and lush tropical gardens. It offers luxurious suites with private plunge pools and butler service.The St. Regis Bali is another luxurious hotel located in Bali. It features stunning views of the ocean and is surrounded by lush tropical gardens. It offers luxurious suites and villas, as well as a variety of amenities such as a spa, a pool, and a range of dining options.Lastly, the Amankila in Bali is a luxurious resort located in Bali. It features beautifully designed villas with stunning views of the ocean. The resort also offers a variety of amenities such as a spa, an outdoor pool, and a range of dining options.What would you say to someone who wants to start their own luxury travel blog?My advice to someone who wants to start their own luxury travel blog is to first, find a niche and focus on a particular region, such as Asia, Europe, or the Caribbean. I\u2019d also recommend creating a visually appealing website, with stunning photos and videos, to capture the reader\u2019s attention.Next, I\u2019d suggest researching other successful luxury travel bloggers to gain an understanding of what type of content they create and what is working for them. Finally, I\u2019d recommend investing in quality equipment and traveling to your desired destinations to provide authentic and engaging content.In the next few years, I want to continue to expand my blog and create more high-quality content. I also want to continue to explore new and exciting destinations and share my experiences with my readers. I\u2019d like to expand my reach and reach a wider audience, so I\u2019m currently working on creating a social media presence.Ultimately, I want to be recognized as a trusted source of information for luxury travelers. I want to provide accurate information and helpful advice, so that travelers can make informed decisions when planning their next trip.Follow Kavin\u2019s blog on Instagram and Facebook.This interview was conducted by David W.

This may have changed in the past couple years since I last took an airline survey. The survey can be found at the top of the page of any website that you have entered. I'll give you a few clues and you can take your time in deciding which airline you want to support by filling out the survey. It takes about 5 minutes.The airline has an interesting name which was used as a code name when they were developing their brand.The airline is located in the Southwestern U.S.The airline's mission statement is, \"To provide the finest passenger experience possible.\"I hope you have some time to take the survey. I'll post the results in a couple days.P.S. We are still looking for a few good airline employees to take the survey. Thank you to the 520 who have already completed it.

            "<s> I'm curious to know which airline you believe offers the best combination of punctuality, in-flight services, and overall passenger satisfaction.What I mean by that is the airline that offers great on-time performance, but without going to the extreme of flying its customers to destinations they don't want to go to, or without making them feel like cattle being herded in and out of airports.The airline that provides outstanding services, but does so without creating an atmosphere where everyone is treated like a millionaire - where some passengers are more important than others.The airline that provides its passengers with the best inflight experience, but without going to the extreme of making sure they get served an unlimited number of snacks and drinks, and where the passenger experience comes before anything else.There are, in my opinion, two primary camps of airlines in the United States: the Southwest and JetBlue camp, and the American and United camp.Which airline is the best for overall satisfaction?I want to know if you agree, disagree, or if you think I'm completely off the mark with my assessments.If so, please vote in the poll below, and explain your vote in the comments.This poll will close at the end of the day on September 12, 2016, so please vote by then if you have a preference.Which Airline Do You Think Provides The Best Overall Experience?Even though I fly about half as often as I used to, I still think that American Airlines provides the best overall flying experience, despite some recent challenges.They're a great airline, and I'm thankful that they're not going to disappear like so many others.Agreed, AA has always been my favorite for a variety of reasons. I still haven't given up on DL (after all these years of bad PR) and I'm hoping they can turn things around, but my choice is always AA.AA is #2 on the list of my most frequent flyers. Their redeye flight to LAX is always the best.It's kind of funny you have Jet Blue and Southwest grouped together since they're the two worst and most annoying airlines I have ever flown with, and that includes flying internationally with Ryanair, Spirit, and Easyjet.There is no doubt that Southwest is a great airline, but I am not a fan of their fares. They have the best on-time performance in the US, but as for on-board services and quality of experience, it depends on the crew you are on and if you are in the front or back of the plane. The new seats on the Boeing 737 MAX will not help either. On a positive note, they are great at boarding, their website and apps work well, and the airports they fly to are good.I think Southwest is one of the better airlines, but I do like Alaska Airlines better as they have more premium economy seats and a good product for that class of service. They are a lot more expensive, but if you want more privacy than you'll get in a Southwest flight and still get good service, then I think Alaska is better.While I can't deny that they offer great service, I'm not a huge fan of Southwest. Their planes are old, they fly to secondary airports, and they are expensive. That being said, I think they do offer a great customer experience.Delta has the worst business class service of any major US airline, hands down. Not only is their domestic business class service mediocre, but when I fly internationally on them, it's horrible. They really are a terrible airline for frequent travelers who value on-board service.I actually prefer the old AA logo over the new one, but I will say that they do a good job and their revenue class international business class service is the best in the US. They just fly to too many international destinations in the US for me to ever consider them my primary airline.I've flown Delta a few times, and while I prefer the service I receive from American, they are still much better than United.</s>",

            "<s> I'm curious to know which airline you believe offers the best combination of punctuality, in-flight services, and overall passenger satisfaction.Punctuality is an obvious area of concern as the aviation industry is under increasing pressure to meet the growing demand for travel by reducing flight cancellations and delays. With this in mind, I\u2019m hoping the results will indicate that punctuality is more of a priority than it currently is.The top three airlines with the best overall score, according to this recent poll, were Etihad, Emirates and Qatar, which is no surprise. After all, these three Middle Eastern airlines are consistently among the world's best when it comes to in-flight services and air quality.However, they didn\u2019t win the punctuality and passenger satisfaction categories. Those two categories went to the low-cost carrier JetBlue and to United Airlines, respectively.The results of this poll, which were shared in the Airliners forum at FlyerTalk, might make you think that budget airlines are the best in terms of punctuality and passenger satisfaction. However, it seems the top three airlines with the best combination of punctuality, in-flight services, and overall passenger satisfaction are three premium international airlines that fly mostly long-haul routes.What is your opinion? Does the list above surprise you?</s>",

If I could avoid them at all costs I would.Other airlines I have flown with (in no particular order):Singapore Airlines is good, but I'd have to give the edge to either Qatar or Cathay Pacific.Cathay Pacific was probably the best I've flown with in terms of service, Qatar Airways for overall flight comfort.This user would like to thank Ruch114 for this useful post:Qatar is a very good airline.

Singapore's seat is fine, if not great. Singapore Airlines is one of the best business class seats around, IMO.I've flown with all of them, with the exception of Emirates, Etihad and Korean. Singapore Airways offers the best overall service in the air and on the ground. I'm flying them again next week, but they don't always offer the best flights (I'm flying on an 8 hour flight on Tuesday, which is probably the worst in the business, and the day before I flew to Europe on a 12 hour flight, and it was good, but not the best).The following 2 users would like to thank Gavin82 for this useful post:wvwvw, yannavSwissair, Air France, Singapore, Emirates and Lufthansa (Swiss is a subsidiary of Lufthansa).

Emirates is next, but they're not as frequent, or as easy to get to.I haven't flown with any of the other airlines on the list, with the exception of Air New Zealand, who are good.Have you flown on Air New Zealand? I'm wondering how it compares to other airlines.I have, I can't really comment on other airlines, but Air New Zealand was very good. The planes are brand new, the crew are friendly, and there is a wide choice of food and drink. They are a smaller airline, but they get around more than Qantas, Virgin, and BA. They also have a decent route network in the USA, Australia, Asia, and the Pacific.I'd definitely recommend them for short to medium haul flights, and I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again.BTW: their service is good on short-haul flights as well, but I can't comment on long-haul flights, as I haven't flown with them for a couple of years.Air New Zealand - ExcellentSingapore - ExcellentBA - PoorEmirates - PoorVirgin - ExcellentLufthansa - ExcellentQantas - PoorDuncanP, Gavin82Boeing 747: Airline industry giant on final flight after 55 years The Local Transport 3 04.10.2016 13:20What are the most common/popular airlines/flight paths in Switzerland?

            "<s> In your view, which airline provides the most outstanding results in terms of comfort, safety, and efficiency in travel?What kind of people are they (as far as you know)? What type of work do they do?What kind of services do they provide?In your view, what are the most important skills that one should possess to work in this field?What is the approximate annual income of those working in this field?In your view, what are the major challenges facing this field?How can we find a career in this field?What are the essential qualifications needed for this career?What kind of people are they (as far as you know)? What kind of work do they do?They are often young men in their mid-twenties to early thirties, with a degree in the aviation field. Most of them are trained on the job but many of the larger companies have training programs. Most companies expect their pilots to obtain a commercial pilot\u2019s license as well as a multi-engine license. Most of them have worked in the aviation field for several years, perhaps as a ground crew, before moving up to a flight crew position. Some of them are married and many of them have children.They are responsible for ensuring that all airport, airline and government procedures are followed. They also make sure that all aircraft are maintained and safe. In addition, the flight crew will make certain that the aircraft is properly loaded with baggage and fuel. They are responsible for the safety and comfort of the passengers on the flight. The flight crew is also responsible for keeping track of the flight plan, monitoring weather and other relevant information and making decisions regarding route, speed and altitude, among other things.Because of the nature of the job, there is a lot of responsibility. They must follow strict guidelines and procedures at all times and if they do not, the consequences can be serious. Therefore, it is important that these employees are highly qualified, trained and professional.As far as I know, they are very professional, hard working, and highly trained. They take pride in their work and are meticulous about safety and the comfort of their passengers.In my view, the most important skills one should possess to work in this field are a high degree of responsibility, the ability to remain calm under pressure, and the ability to think on your feet.As I stated earlier, it is an extremely high-stress and high-responsibility job. The pilot and co-pilot are the ones in charge of the plane and responsible for the lives of the passengers on board. As a result, they need to be highly organized and able to prioritize and make split-second decisions.Their salaries will depend on the airline and the type of aircraft they fly. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, airline pilots earn a median salary of $102,500 per year and flight engineers earn a median salary of $92,460 per year.I do not think there are any major challenges facing this field. It is a highly respected and very lucrative job with a high degree of responsibility. The only challenge I can think of would be that you would be subject to stress and the potential for injury in the event of an emergency or an accident.You should make sure that you are qualified and that you have the necessary training and experience. You should also make sure that you have a valid license and that you have a good safety record.The qualifications needed for this career include having a high school diploma, having a commercial pilot\u2019s license, having a multi-engine license, and having good communication and organizational skills.In your view, what are the major challenges facing this field?How can we find a career in this field?What kind of people are they (as far as you know)?

            "<s> When it comes to choosing an airline, which one do you think stands out in terms of its fleet quality, route network, and commitment to passenger well-being? That would be Singapore Airlines.For starters, the national flag carrier has one of the youngest and most well-maintained fleets in the industry. As of 2015, the company boasts 111 aircraft in its mainline fleet with an average age of 8.7 years. As you may know, the average age of an aircraft in commercial use is 15 years. In contrast, Southwest Airlines, a low-cost US carrier, has an average fleet age of 11.4 years.The company is known for its premium passenger experience, exemplified by its five-star services. And now, Singapore Airlines is on the move, once again taking the passenger experience to a new level of comfort and convenience.In an interview with Bloomberg, Singapore Airlines CEO, Mr. Goh Choon Phong said that in 2016, the company is set to fly its first A350 aircraft, a next-generation wide-body aircraft that boasts more cabin space than the B777-300ER, more efficient fuel consumption, and a longer range.Singapore Airlines A350: More Room, More Comfort, More Fuel-EfficiencyIt has been quite some time since Singapore Airlines first ordered for its own A350 XWB fleet back in 2007. The A350 XWB, also called the Airbus Xtra Wide-Body, is a family of two-engine wide-body long-haul airliners developed by European aircraft manufacturer, Airbus. The XWB stands for the extra-wide fuselage with two separate cabin widths, a wider one in the middle section for premium economy seats, and a slimmer one on the sides for economy seats.The A350 XWB features an all-new lightweight composite airframe, which cuts the aircraft weight by more than 50 percent. The airframe allows for new cabin features, including larger windows and taller ceilings that can provide more space for seating and storage.The aircraft is 68.8-feet long with a wing-span of 249-feet. It can accommodate up to 366 passengers, of which 44 passengers can travel in the 28-inch wide first class seats and 248 can travel in a 3-class layout comprising 38-inch wide economy class seats, 21-inch wide premium economy seats, and 18-inch wide business class seats.Compared to its nearest competitors, such as the B777-300ER, the Airbus A350 offers a higher maximum speed at 0.95 Mach, which is 220-mph faster than the B777-300ER, while maintaining an operating efficiency of 29% less than the B777-300ER. The A350 can fly non-stop from Singapore to New York in 15 hours and 17 minutes and from San Francisco to Tokyo in 15 hours and 55 minutes.In an interview with Flight Global, Choon Phong stated that the new aircraft will replace the airline\u2019s B777-300ERs and will be deployed on the flights to New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. The first A350 XWB will come into operation in 2017, which will fly the Singapore-Sydney route. It is worth mentioning that the B777-300ERs and B777-200s will be retained as part of the carrier\u2019s long-haul fleet.Other Major Airline OperatorsThe A350 XWB was developed by the European aircraft manufacturer, Airbus, as a response to the Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner, which offers a longer range than its predecessor, the 777. Boeing has delivered 706 787s, which has received an overwhelming response from its operator customers, including Singapore Airlines\u2019 local rival, Singapore-based low-cost carrier, Scoot.Lufthansa is the largest customer of the A350 XWB, operating a fleet of 50 A350s and counting. The German airline is in the process of receiving the deliveries of the aircraft, which will be deployed on the carrier\u2019s long-haul routes. In 2015, Singapore Airlines received its first A350-900 aircraft and plans to operate it on its flights to Sydney and Tokyo.All images were used under the Fair Use doctrine.

            "<s> Seeking insights on the most commendable airline \u2013 the one that truly sets the standard for ensuring a seamless and enjoyable flying experience. It is my hope that readers can share your thoughts and insights about your airline of choice. The poll is open for the month of July.My family and I just recently experienced a flight from SFO-ORD on AA flight 2251, and it was one of the worst flying experiences we have ever had. I have to ask why AA would allow a customer to purchase a business class ticket and then force them to sit in the coach cabin. I have to assume that AA had no problem with this customer buying a business class ticket for this flight. Why did they let the customer leave the airport without notifying them and/or the customer that the customer would be seated in a coach class seat? I feel the AA flight attendants and the AA customer service representatives should have notified the customer and/or the customer should have been advised to get a refund. We felt like we were being treated poorly by the AA flight attendants and the AA customer service representatives.After a long day of business meetings, I was so pleased to board my AA 1795 flight from Charlotte to LGA. The flight attendants and gate crew were all professional and efficient. It was nice to be able to work while flying since I\u2019m on the laptop. They were all attentive to passengers\u2019 needs and provided great service.</s>",

We recently sought to discover this airline by asking travellers across Asia Pacific about their flying experiences with some of the region\u2019s airlines, with the objective to uncover the one airline they believe really stands out.The findings of this research are captured in the first edition of Airline Brand Research \u2013 a new report from Collinson, in which we explored the brands that make flying a more enjoyable experience and uncovered the airline that comes out on top.What makes an airline the best of the best?According to travellers surveyed, Singapore Airlines is the clear winner for the airline that offers an overall superior travel experience.

The internet is another rich resource. But, as much as airlines try to promote themselves as the best, a better way to find out what the public thinks is to ask them directly.The airline customer satisfaction research that Airline Quality Rating (AQR) has been performing for more than 30 years provides the best picture of what passengers think. AQR was formed in 1987 to objectively assess the quality of service airline customers receive, by measuring three factors in the customer experience:On-time performance (delays and cancellations)Baggage handling (lost, mishandled and delayed bags)Flight rescheduling and refunds (the level of customer service provided for the above)The results of AQR\u2019s latest annual survey, released in May 2018, revealed that in 2017, Alaska Airlines ranked highest among large U.S. airlines in the quality of its customer service, with a score of 812 out of a possible 850. Spirit Airlines ranked lowest, with a score of 553.Since then, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have merged, but Southwest is still ranked above American, with a score of 744 out of 850. Spirit Airlines, with its score of 553 out of 850, remains ranked last.\u201cWhen you consider that Alaska Airlines has been around since 1932, has no hubs, and operates a mix of small and large aircraft, its top ranking is not surprising,\u201d says John Braden, an expert in airline marketing and finance, and one of the founders of AQR. \u201cOn-time performance is one of the most important attributes for a successful airline, as it is closely tied to customer loyalty, and Alaska performs extremely well in this regard.\u201dWith Alaska Airlines\u2019 high quality score, it is no wonder that it was voted Airline of the Year 2018 by Airline Ratings, a website that uses industry ratings from the Airline Quality Rating report to determine its annual airline of the year award. It is also considered to be one of the best airlines in the world, alongside Qantas Airways and Air New Zealand.The airline is known for having an impeccable safety record and it also excels in customer service. It has received many awards in this regard, such as the 2018 Top Workplace by Seattle Times, a rating based on employee survey responses, and Best Airline for the Pacific and Best Airline in North America in the Travel + Leisure World\u2019s Best Awards 2018.\u201cAnother thing that makes Alaska Airlines stand out is its customer-friendly fare policy,\u201d says Braden. \u201cIt does not restrict the number of stops that you can make and does not charge for bags or carry-on bags that are within the size limits.\u201dThe airline has also adopted a friendly policy towards pets, allowing animals in-cabin and free of charge.

The result is a super-airline, with top-notch service and the latest tech, making it a favorite among travelers.\u201cAlaska Airlines is an excellent choice for travelers,\u201d says Braden. \u201cIts service is reliable and of high quality, it is known for its animal-friendly policy, and it provides an overall positive customer experience.\u201d</s>"

For example, airline A might be really reliable in Europe, but when you connect with an airline B that airline's network doesn't reach your destination.In the US most airlines are generally reliable and comfortable. I personally like United, Alaska and Southwest the best.The one thing you are not asking about in your question is price. But price is very important when selecting your airline. This question would be too broad for any reasonable answer, since the \"best\" price varies greatly depending on departure location, arrival location, date, time, and class.I agree, and price also depends on the class. In the US a long haul coach seat costs a lot more than a short haul one.Not the answer you're looking for?

            "<s> I'm in search of the top-notch airline; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between reliability, comfort, and overall travel convenience?I've flown Southwest quite a bit, but it's not always the most convenient for me when I'm traveling between the West Coast and the East Coast. If I had to pick my top three airlines, Southwest, JetBlue, and American would be at the top of the list. Each airline offers something different but all are reputable, with stellar customer service and the best in-flight experience in my opinion.I'd pick the one that flies into the airport closest to your destination. But I'd recommend using Google Flights to search for cheap flights to different airports in the same city. Then, look up each airport's location and convenience to the rest of the city and select the one that's most convenient for you. This might mean flying in to the smaller, closer airport (usually, this is called a \"hub\" airport) and taking the commuter rail, or bus, or another form of public transportation to get to your final destination. It's all about convenience.</s>",
            "<s> I'm in search of the top-notch airline; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between reliability, comfort, and overall travel convenience?Southwest, Delta, United. Those are the \"big 3\" that have very similar networks, with slightly different emphasis.Southwest is a good option for the west coast to Vegas, Orlando, and Hawaii. Southwest also flies to some unique destinations, including Anchorage and BWI (Baltimore-Washington). Delta flies to a lot of cities (especially east coast, but also the midwest) that United does not. Both Southwest and Delta offer Wi-Fi on all their aircraft.If you need to fly somewhere off the beaten path and want a domestic airline, Allegiant flies all over the midwest, south, and west coast.The one I'm most concerned with is Southwest's on-time performance. I've read a few complaints about how they don't really care about that.In terms of the overall experience on the plane, how does each one compare? Which is best for comfort and amenities?Southwest has the best seats in the business, and best customer service. The only downside is the lack of a premium cabin for people who want to sleep on a flight (although they have that on some international flights).Delta flies newest planes (they just received 20 new Airbus A350 planes, for example), but they're still using old seats (which don't lie flat).United is in between on the quality of seats.What are the benefits of using Allegiant? How does that fit into the scheme?Allegiant has the worst reputation for on-time performance, and the worst customer service. However, if you live in the midwest and have to fly somewhere off the beaten path, Allegiant is the best option. They have very cheap, last-minute, super-easy to book fares (especially if you don't care about being on time).Delta is better than United in terms of flight quality (but worse than Southwest in terms of flight quality).Airline's reliability and comfort depend heavily on the day of travel and the type of flight (international vs domestic). You need to keep all that in mind when booking your tickets.I recommend buying tickets with no hidden fees.All airlines have hidden fees for checking in a bag, for changing or canceling a ticket, etc. However, many times you can book a ticket for free with no hidden fees and pay for extras later if you need to. For example, I was able to get a round-trip flight to Europe for $1000 with Southwest. Then I added checked bags for $55, and I was good to go.All airlines fly to similar destinations. There are some that are better at certain routes.If you are looking for the cheapest flight then go to Kayak.com. If you are looking for the best flight to certain city, use Google Flights.Southwest is cheaper than Delta on many routes, and Southwest is better than United in terms of overall quality of the airline (both flight quality and customer service).Delta's international service is very good, and you might be able to find a better price on Delta than on any other airline. United and Southwest also fly international, but they do not fly to the same countries as Delta.Southwest flies to Hawaii, and you can only fly to Hawaii on United or Delta.If you live in the midwest and you need to fly to somewhere off the beaten path (say, Cancun), Allegiant is a good option.For more information, I recommend reading our article about the best airlines in the US.I hope this information helps you with planning your next trip!</s>",

            "<s> I'm in search of the top-notch airline; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between reliability, comfort, and overall travel convenience?By \"reliability\" I mean low delay (even if it means 1 hr delay in most cases) and high safety (which may mean no delays, but no one wants that). I've always been loyal to the airline that has a great on-time record and safety record and that I can trust will get me from point A to B on time, but also makes me feel comfortable. I'm looking for an airline that offers the best of both worlds -- not too high a comfort factor but not too high of a safety factor. I'm leaning toward either Northwest or United. Any other suggestions? I've already eliminated American because they seem to be a little shady with their \"on-time\" records (and they're not the most comfortable, either).As always, any suggestions are greatly appreciated.I don't have specific advice for you, but I do have this to say:Which airline are you flying with? Do you have a particular departure point?It's a long, boring flight from Chicago O'Hare to Tampa.No particular departure point, as long as the airline has a hub that services that route (I'll be flying from the NYC area, so it'd be nice if the airline also has a hub in NYC, too). But, if you know of a good airline that services a different route, please let me know.Based on personal experience, I would say Northwest. I've never had a problem with them, they are very safe and on time. They are very customer friendly, and I feel safe flying with them. They seem to be more professional than United, and I've been on one hell of a bad United flight. (NYC to Orlando.)I think the question of whether to choose an airline based on safety or comfort is kind of a false dilemma. You can always get good service and decent legroom without putting yourself in danger.I fly United every couple of weeks and I've never had any problems. Their service is good and I've never felt unsafe in one of their planes. I think they are very reliable and safe.I would avoid Northwest unless you must fly their shuttle service between Minneapolis/St. Paul and Chicago. Their on-time record is not good.AirTran is the best I've ever flown and they have the best record of any major carrier on-time. But they are not on most hub and spoke networks. The only places I fly with them are Miami to Tampa, Orlando to Tampa and Atlanta to Tampa.I'd recommend American, which was pretty much a given, until the recent airline merger. American used to be a favorite of mine, but things have changed (for the worse) lately. United Airlines is my favorite, but if you can find a better value somewhere else, go for it.I'd avoid Southwest. They're not quite as reliable, and they're pretty uncomfortable. Plus you can't even get a seat assignment. You're assigned a zone, but if they overbook, you might have to stand. I've been in that position on several occasions. It sucks.American Airlines. They've got a nice fleet of Boeing 757's, and a solid track record. You may be interested in their Business Class product. I fly them from New York-JFK to Miami and back all the time.I will avoid United at all costs, thanks to their not-so-great safety record. Plus they're uncomfortable and they overbook.If your travels are limited to the Northeast, I'd recommend US Airways. They've got a solid track record. Plus I've found them to be very helpful if you need to make a change or cancel a flight.I wouldn't fly Delta. They're uncomfortable, their track record isn't great, and they're very stingy about redeposits and refunds.There are a few others I like, but I don't think any of them are in your area. I'm also partial to JetBlue, but they don't fly to New York.Honestly, the best way to avoid uncomfortable or unsafe planes is to travel during off-peak times (or when possible, fly on Friday or Sunday). Airlines are most likely to send their most modern fleets on the more profitable routes, so if you can avoid rush hour, you'll be flying with the best.You're right about American, but that has more to do with the bankruptcy than the merger. That said, I used to prefer American. I used to have an AAdvantage number and everything... I've just seen a steady decline in service in the last year or so. I think most of the problems have to do with their merger with the bankrupt bankrupt US Air. I'm glad that the merger is finally complete, but American has been a little rough in their efforts to integrate the two companies.I like United, but I agree, their service has gone downhill in the last year or so. They have too many planes that need maintenance, and their hub in Chicago is becoming more and more congested. There's not a lot of room to grow there, either, because they've built up the airport as far as they can.I'm not a big fan of Southwest, but their planes are pretty good. Their passengers are the type you have to watch out for on a plane though... notorious cutters. I've seen people get into serious fights over cutting in line for the bathroom at Southwest. And those people were not getting into a fist fight.Delta is pretty good, too. They're just a little stingy with their mileage program. I like their seats though. I also like their on-time track record. I have a feeling that if I flew with Delta every day, I'd really like them.Southwest, I've heard, is great at baggage handling, so that's a plus. But their fleet is pretty old. They need to get new planes. I think their next generation of planes, which will arrive in about three years, will be a lot better, but right now, I wouldn't fly Southwest.</s>",
            "<s> I'm in search of the top-notch airline; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between reliability, comfort, and overall travel convenience?I'm currently flying Air India for all my international flights. For me, AI is very good on service and quality. But it's quite unreliable with schedules and I've been late or missed a few flights due to that.I've heard about Cathay Pacific, but the reviews I've found on the net are quite split. There are plenty of reviews saying that Cathay is the best airline, but there are also some people saying that Cathay is just average.Can someone with more experience than I provide some insight? Is Cathay good? Or are there better airlines out there?Comments for Which airline is the best?Which airline should I fly?I think the answer will depend on where you are travelling from and where to and where you are travelling to. For example, if you are travelling from Australia to the US, then your options will be limited, but if you are travelling to Australia from the US then you will have more options. Also, if you are traveling to Europe then your options will be more limited as well.Also, there are budget airlines that you can use, but I would stay away from those. I would rather pay a little more and travel on a premium carrier.All that being said, if I was choosing between Qantas and Cathay, I would choose Cathay because of the quality of service that they provide. They have won many awards for being the best airline and they have been around longer than Qantas.Hi. I've had good experiences flying Singapore Airlines.Also, I've read a lot about how Qantas is the top airline in Australia, and I can vouch for that.However, if you're traveling from Australia, then Cathay Pacific is a good airline to try. They're not as good as Singapore or Qantas, but I would certainly give them a try.</s>",

            "<s> I'm in search of the top-notch airline; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between reliability, comfort, and overall travel convenience?Here are three different things that may be important to you.1. Comfort. What is important to one person may not be to another. If you are a business traveler who flies frequently then you might find something like a 787 a bit more comfortable than someone who is a less frequent flyer.2. Timing. Sometimes you have to fly at a specific time. You can make any flight work, but at what cost? This is especially true with respect to an airline that has many flights a day.3. Safety. It sounds simplistic, but the most important thing is to fly with a reputable airline that has good safety ratings. The most important rating is the safety rating of the entire airline.I like Emirates because they have an excellent safety record. They fly a lot of older A380s, but they have a modern fleet and they have been buying up new Airbus A380s for a couple of years now.I like British Airways because they are a good airline. They are not the cheapest, but they are a good airline. And they have a lot of flights a day and so their flights are quite frequent.If you are traveling to Europe, then you should fly with a European airline, because they are a lot safer than U.S. airlines.
