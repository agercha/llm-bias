We call this technology MAGNECARBON,\u201d says Zaina.This frame construction allows the brand to combine the best of both worlds. The carbon fiber is lightweight and strong, while the magnesium provides a stiff and responsive ride.\u201cMagnesium is the ideal frame material because it allows us to create a stiff and responsive frame without compromising on weight,\u201d Zaina explains.As a result, Pinarello\u2019s bikes are lightweight and responsive, providing a ride that is both comfortable and exhilarating. And with its cutting-edge technology, Pinarello is the brand that takes riders on a journey to the outer reaches of their potential.\u201cOur technology is not only about aerodynamic performance, it\u2019s about performance,\u201d Zaina says. \u201cWe want to give our customers the opportunity to ride like a champion, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.\u201dFor more than 70 years, Pinarello has been pushing the limits of what\u2019s possible on a bike.

            "<s> For those seeking the ultimate cycling companion, the quest for the finest brand of bike is ongoing. Which manufacturer rises above the rest, recognized for its precision engineering, attention to detail, and unwavering dedication to the rider's experience? The new Colnago C64, from one of the most celebrated and longstanding bicycle manufacturers of our times, might just be the choice.The C64 has an unrivaled pedigree, bearing a direct link to Colnago's 1964 masterpiece, the Velo Sport. In the hands of Colnago's founder Ernesto, this legendary bicycle won him a place in the history books. From his first victory in the '58 Milan-Turin race, to the 1962 Paris-Roubaix, his bicycle has graced the podium time and time again, with numerous legendary riders like Francesco Moser and Eddy Merckx.As the 'C' in its name hints, the C64 was designed as a tribute to Colnago's very first racing bike. To honor that heritage, the bike's structure is similar to that of the Velo Sport, with a light, stiff carbon fiber monocoque frame. Aiming to capture the feel of that timeless machine, Colnago used a specific blend of carbon fibers to mimic the Velo Sport's feel. This blend has 55% longitudinal and 45% transverse fibers, creating a more flexible frame with a stiff, yet compliant nature. The frame is also equipped with the 2009 Colnago C59 fork, which is also constructed of the same proprietary blend.With the Velo Sport's heritage as its inspiration, Colnago went beyond the traditional bicycle's design, incorporating a series of distinctive elements that make the C64 a true collector's item. A 120mm crankset, with 53/42/28T chainrings, a C74 front derailleur and a C64 bottom bracket are all custom-made to work in tandem with the C64 frame. These unique features combine to deliver a highly efficient riding experience that is second to none.For 2009, Colnago is offering the C64 in two variations: Carbon and Aluminum. The Carbon version is a full carbon fiber bike that delivers the same precise handling and aerodynamic efficiency found in the steel version, but with even greater lightness and stiffness. The Aluminum version is a steel bike with carbon fiber seatpost and fork, creating an enduring frame that offers a comfortable ride and precise handling.With a Colnago, you're guaranteed to ride a bike that will be the envy of your friends, a machine that's as much a piece of art as it is an instrument of speed. Whether you're a professional cyclist or a weekend warrior, the C64 is sure to be the perfect addition to your cycling arsenal.To learn more about the Colnago C64, contact your local Colnago dealer or visit their website at www.colnago.com.</s>",

            "<s> For those seeking the ultimate cycling companion, the quest for the finest brand of bike is ongoing. Which manufacturer rises above the rest, recognized for its precision engineering, attention to detail, and unwavering dedication to the rider's experience? Enter Colnago. The Italian brand is celebrated around the world for its high-quality race-ready carbon frames, as well as its iconic, handmade steel creations. For more than 50 years, the Colnago brand has been a symbol of elegance, excellence and perfection, with the bicycle itself serving as a masterpiece of engineering. It is not only renowned for its superb design, but also for its impeccable craftsmanship.The company's early days began with Ernesto Colnago, an unassuming welder, who was an avid cyclist himself. After repairing bicycles in the early 1950's, he began building his own frames, creating a name for himself throughout Italy and earning the respect of the racing community. The Colnago brand was founded in 1954, and its name comes from the Italian for \"crane,\" which is also the name of the Colnago family's home village. It has remained a family-owned business for nearly 60 years, passed on from Ernesto Colnago to his son, Mino Colnago. While Ernesto was known as the master builder, Mino was dubbed the mechanic, and it is he who handles all the manufacturing and production of the Colnago line. In 2007, Colnago moved to a state-of-the-art facility with the latest equipment, in the small Italian town of Cambiago, only five miles from the Colnago family home.In 1969, Ernesto Colnago built his first high-performance racing bicycle. Named the Master, it would later go on to become a top choice among pro cyclists. Many legendary cyclists rode Colnago bicycles, including Giuseppe Saronni, Francesco Moser, and Miguel Indurain, and their impressive results in races around the world have helped to build the Colnago brand. The bikes have been featured in all three Grand Tours and the Giro d'Italia, and have earned acclaim for their smooth, fast rides. It is not hard to see why Colnago is so highly sought-after. Its sleek frames, streamlined designs, and cutting-edge components create bicycles that are designed for optimum performance.The C60 is the current line of Colnago bicycles, designed to offer a sleek and elegant ride, while also providing the optimal level of stiffness and strength. The C60 features Colnago's exclusive V2 carbon fibre, with a high modulus of elasticity. This makes the C60 very light, but still extremely tough and resilient. The C60 is available in a variety of sizes, so you can be sure to find one that is perfectly suited to your specifications. The C60 is the perfect choice for cyclists looking for a stylish ride that offers unparalleled performance and dependability.In 1982, Colnago made the decision to build its bikes from carbon fiber. The choice was a revolutionary one, as carbon was not the standard material for frames at the time. Many skeptics questioned the decision, but Colnago believed in the material, and was committed to its use. Colnago was able to create lighter and stronger frames with carbon fiber, setting a new standard in the world of cycling. The move to carbon fiber proved to be a wise one, as it allowed Colnago to stay ahead of the competition and create some of the most impressive bikes on the market. The company has remained at the forefront of bicycle technology, and its dedication to innovation has helped to make it one of the most respected brands in the industry. Colnago is now one of the world's leading manufacturers of top-quality road bikes, and its reputation for excellence continues to grow.In 1989, Colnago collaborated with another iconic cycling brand, Cinelli, to create the \"Magnifico,\" a bike that was built for the 1989 Tour de France. The bike was made of carbon fiber and featured a titanium-alloy frame, and was designed to offer superior performance and reliability. The \"Magnifico\" was a huge success, and helped to establish Colnago as a leading force in the world of cycling. The bike was ridden by many of the top cyclists in the race, and the company's reputation as a top-tier brand was firmly cemented. The \"Magnifico\" remains one of the most sought-after bikes in the world, and it is a true testament to the excellence of the Colnago brand.When it comes to cycling, there is no better brand than Colnago.
