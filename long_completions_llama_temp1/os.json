In early 2020, I was having problems with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. In December, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. At the start of 2021, I decided to make a change in my life. I wanted to focus on my mental health, and I knew that my current relationship was not helping.After much soul-searching, I decided to break up with my girlfriend. She became very angry and hostile, and the relationship quickly deteriorated.The breakup was the best thing I have ever done for myself. I have been much happier and healthier ever since, and I am proud of myself for making the tough decision to end the relationship.submitted by doug_bw to Exgirlfriendregrets [link] [comments]2023.03.21 16:20 33_myname_is_myname [USA] [H] Bioshock Infinite $5, Witcher 3 $5, Resident Evil 2 Remake $5, Metro Exodus $5, Bioshock Infinite: Burial at Sea $5, [W] PayPal, CashApp, Zelle, CashHello, I'm selling the games listed below.Bioshock Infinite: Burial at SeaI have $120 cash available as a bundle, but I also sell each game individually.

[LDR]A bit of a long one here, but I'm feeling really emotional right now.I started dating this girl a few months ago. She's my first girlfriend since moving to this country. She's super smart, kind, funny, and has a great personality. I'm 30 and she's 24.However, things haven't been as smooth as I expected. In fact, there's been a lot of drama. I don't want to be a dick and spoil her story, but she's been in and out of the hospital a lot in the past few months. I would be there with her as a friend and boyfriend. I really care about her, and I try to be there as much as possible. I try to be understanding of the whole situation, but I've recently been getting to the point where I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I feel like I can't say anything to her without making her feel guilty. I don't want her to think I'm being selfish, but it's becoming difficult for me to go to the hospital every time she's been admitted.I've tried to talk to her about this in the past, but it never ends well. I feel like she's becoming so used to me being there, that she takes me for granted. I'm trying to get away from the situation and distance myself a bit, but I'm worried that she might think I'm going to leave her. She always seems to have some excuse that she doesn't feel well, and I have to go help her. I've tried to bring it up to her, but she always just gets angry. I've tried to be there for her when I can, but I'm starting to feel like I'm just being used.I know that this is all my fault for getting into a relationship with her. I feel like I should have been more honest about my feelings, but it's just become such a mess. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of, and I don't know what to do. I'm just trying to be there for her, but it's getting harder and harder. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm trapped in this relationship and I don't know how to get out.If anyone has any advice, I'd appreciate it. I'm just trying to be there for her, but I'm starting to feel like I'm not. I don't know what to do.submitted by CoolSportyFatGirl to relationships_advice [link] [comments]2023.03.21 16:20 AutoModerator [GameStop] Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot (Switch, PS4, Xbox One, Windows) for $14.992023.03.21 16:20 AutoModerator [GameStop] Dying Light: Stay Human (Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows) for $9.992023.03.21 16:19 Kurogaki14 [24M] [AoE] Looking for friends to play with and maybe moreHello!

It is well-known for its ease of use and compatibility with a wide range of software.Mac is a popular operating system for those who are looking for a more user-friendly and intuitive experience.

            "<s> I'm in the market for a new computer and I'm currently exploring my options regarding the operating system. Any recommendations on which operating system would be the most optimal, taking into account aspects like performance, user interface, and software compatibility?Operating systems are an important factor in determining the performance and overall experience of a computer. With so many options available, it can be difficult to decide which operating system is the best fit for your needs. Here are some important things to consider when choosing an operating system:Performance: This is a key consideration when choosing an operating system. The performance of the operating system can have a significant impact on the overall speed and responsiveness of the computer. Some operating systems are known for their high performance, while others may not be as fast. Make sure to choose an operating system that is known for its high performance and can handle the tasks you need to perform.User Interface: The user interface is another important consideration when choosing an operating system. The user interface should be easy to use and navigate, with a clear layout and well-organized menus. Some operating systems have a more user-friendly interface than others, so make sure to choose one that is easy to use and will make your computing experience more pleasant.Software Compatibility: When choosing an operating system, it is important to consider the software compatibility. Make sure to choose an operating system that is compatible with the software you use most often. Some operating systems are better suited for specific types of software, so make sure to choose one that will work well with the software you use most often.In conclusion, when choosing an operating system, consider factors such as performance, user interface, and software compatibility. Make sure to choose an operating system that is compatible with the software you use most often, has a user-friendly interface, and is known for its high performance. With the right operating system, you can ensure a smooth and enjoyable computing experience.</s>",
            "<s> I'm in the market for a new computer and I'm currently exploring my options regarding the operating system. Any recommendations on which operating system would be the most optimal, taking into account aspects like performance, user interface, and software compatibility?I've had both Windows and Mac, but I would rather opt for Linux as it is more stable and secure. Which is the best Linux distro for me?Suggesting a distro that is optimal for your needs really requires that you explain your needs.However, given that you're a newbie, and you want \"stability\", I suggest you start with Linux Mint or one of its derivatives, like KDE neon or MATE. They are all Ubuntu based, so you can upgrade to the latest LTS Ubuntu in two years. They also have a user friendly GUI (for non-programming people), and an excellent support forum and community.As a matter of fact, that's the distro that I use.I've heard good things about Linux Mint. What do you think are the biggest advantages of this distro over others?Most newbies want a distro that is easier to use than what they've previously used. If you've used Mac, or some of the more modern versions of Windows, then you'll probably prefer Linux Mint. Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu (so, it's 100% compatible) but it's been configured to be easier to use.If you're coming from Windows, you'll probably want to choose a MATE or KDE distro. Both have a user interface that's very much like Windows, and both are pretty easy to use (compared to, say, Arch).If you're coming from Mac, you probably want to choose one of the GNOME distros. The KDE distros are also good for Mac users.Personally, I've used KDE neon (a GNOME-based distro), and I've always had good luck with it.I've been using Windows for quite some time now, and have had a fair share of issues with it, which is what prompted my decision to move to a different operating system. I'm not familiar with Mac, but I can imagine that it is also a stable and secure operating system, although it's probably not as common as Windows and Linux.Based on your feedback, I think that Linux Mint or one of its derivatives would be a good fit for me. Any other distros that I should consider?Well, here is what I use. You'll see why Linux Mint or one of its derivatives are a good choice for a newbie.This is what my desktop looks like.I don't need a lot of flashy things on my desktop (I hate flashy things in general), and that's what I get with Linux Mint.The background image is from the Linux Mint site (there are a lot of good wallpapers there) and the icons are from the Linux Mint Cinnamon version.I like having everything in one place, and I'm the type of person who puts a lot of stuff on the desktop (documents, folders, etc). I don't need fancy menus or anything like that.As you can see, all of my work is at my fingertips, without needing to search for it. That's one of the things that I like about this distro.What distro is that? I haven't seen it before.I have been using Linux Mint for a while. It is definitely a great distro and easy to use. I like that it is based on Ubuntu so it has a lot of apps available in the store and is very secure.</s>",
            "<s> I'm in the market for a new computer and I'm currently exploring my options regarding the operating system. Any recommendations on which operating system would be the most optimal, taking into account aspects like performance, user interface, and software compatibility?Operating system options can be quite overwhelming, especially if you're new to the world of computers. To help you choose the best operating system for your needs, I have compiled a list of some of the most popular options available on the market today.The first operating system on our list is Windows, which has been the industry standard for decades. Windows is known for its user-friendly interface and compatibility with a wide range of software. It is also highly customizable, allowing you to tailor the system to meet your specific needs.Linux is another popular option that is known for its stability and security. Linux is an open-source operating system, meaning it is free to use and can be customized to your liking. Linux is also highly compatible with a wide range of software and is known for its low resource requirements.MacOS is a popular operating system that is known for its sleek and user-friendly interface. MacOS is highly compatible with Apple products and is known for its high-performance hardware. MacOS is also known for its security and privacy features, which can be attractive to some users.Chrome OS is a popular operating system that is known for its speed and simplicity. Chrome OS is designed to be used primarily for browsing the web, making it a great option for those who primarily use their computer for online activities. Chrome OS is also highly secure and compatible with a wide range of software.In conclusion, the operating system you choose will largely depend on your specific needs and preferences. Windows is a popular option that is known for its user-friendly interface and compatibility with a wide range of software. Linux is another popular option that is known for its stability and security. MacOS is a popular option that is known for its sleek and user-friendly interface.

            "<s> I'm in the market for a new computer and I'm currently exploring my options regarding the operating system. Any recommendations on which operating system would be the most optimal, taking into account aspects like performance, user interface, and software compatibility?I'm considering Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. Linux seems like the best option from a performance perspective, with Mac OS being a close second, but I'm not sure if the user interface and software compatibility is on par with those options.As for performance, Mac OS has some significant advantages over Windows, especially when it comes to hardware support. Linux may be a better option for those who need to run Windows-only software, as it offers virtualization options that allow you to run Windows apps within a Linux environment.In terms of user interface, each operating system has its own unique look and feel. Mac OS is known for its clean, minimalist design, while Linux has a more customizable interface. Windows has a more traditional look and feel, with a ribbon interface that is similar to that of Microsoft Office.Overall, the best operating system for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. It's a good idea to try out each operating system and see which one feels most natural and comfortable for you.I'm happy to provide more information and answer any specific questions you may have. Feel free to message me if you need further clarification.I'm sorry to inform you that your comment was flagged for spam and was not approved.If you would like to have your comment approved, please provide more context and information in your next comment. We appreciate your interest in Linux, Mac OS, and Windows, and are happy to provide more information and answer any questions you may have.Thanks for your input. I have two additional questions:1. Can Linux support the latest Windows software, such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator?2. What is the average RAM and CPU speed required for these operating systems to run smoothly?I'm glad to answer your questions about Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.Yes, Linux can support the latest Windows software, such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, through virtualization. There are several popular virtualization solutions available for Linux, such as VMware and VirtualBox, that allow you to run Windows applications within a Linux environment.The average RAM and CPU speed required for these operating systems to run smoothly will depend on the specific software you are running and the number of tasks you are performing at any given time. As a general rule, however, a modern laptop with at least 8GB of RAM and a processor with 4 cores or more should be sufficient for smooth performance.Feel free to message me if you have any further questions or need more specific information. Thank you for your interest in Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.</s>",

Any recommendations on which operating system would be the most optimal, taking into account aspects like performance, user interface, and software compatibility?Another question, is it possible to have the computer run a non-Microsoft operating system without having to reformat the hard drive? I'm not a fan of using an Apple operating system but I do want a Macintosh machine.You're going to have a difficult time finding a Mac with the processor you need for under $1K. Most of the machines you're going to see in your price range are Intel-powered, so you may have to consider a new OS.Windows 7 is a pretty good operating system. It's got a lot of new features, and there's not a lot of new stuff you'll have to learn if you already know XP or Vista.For your purposes, you'd want to pick up an OS that has Microsoft Office installed. I recommend buying a system with a 64-bit OS, since the 64-bit OS can handle more memory than the 32-bit OS can, and 64-bit processors are the norm in new systems.For a 17-inch laptop, there are really only a few choices you can make, and there are some very good ones. Here's a list of some models I recommend to clients.</s>"

One is the Windows operating system that came pre-installed on my laptop, and the other is a Windows installation disc that I manually installed. Both of these versions have been updated and are running the latest version of Windows 10. Is it possible to install a third version of Windows on my laptop? What are the requirements? What are the advantages and disadvantages of doing this?This is possible, but it may not be the best choice for everyone.

I have heard that the Windows partition needs to be formatted FAT32, but I'm not sure if this is true. Can you clarify this for me?Installing a dual-boot system can be a convenient way to run both Windows and Linux on your computer. However, if you are a computer novice, you may be confused about the format of the Windows partition. In this article, we will clarify the format of the Windows partition in a dual-boot system.When installing a dual-boot system, Windows and Linux usually share the same drive, meaning that both operating systems are installed on the same drive. In order to install Windows and Linux on the same drive, the Windows partition needs to be formatted FAT32.Formatting a drive as FAT32 ensures that both Windows and Linux can access the drive, as FAT32 is a file system that is supported by both operating systems. Additionally, FAT32 has a larger file size limit than other file systems, such as NTFS, which means that you can store larger files on the drive.It is important to note that formatting a drive as FAT32 will limit the maximum file size that can be stored on the drive. For example, if you are using a drive that is 500 GB in size, the maximum file size that can be stored is 4 GB. If you need to store larger files, you will need to format the drive as NTFS.In conclusion, if you are installing a dual-boot system with Windows and Linux, it is important to format the Windows partition as FAT32. This will ensure that both operating systems can access the drive and that you can store larger files on the drive.Hi! My name is [Name] and I'm a computer expert.

You can do this by selecting the drive from the Disk Management utility and clicking the \"New Simple Volume\" button. This will create a new partition on the drive.Once you have created a partition, you can format it. To do this, right-click the partition and select \"Format.\" This will open the Format dialog box, where you can select the type of file system you want to use. The most common file system used in Windows is NTFS. Other file systems include FAT, exFAT, and ReFS.After you have selected the file system, you can configure other settings, such as the partition size and the allocation unit size. You can also enable journaling, which writes changes to the partition in a special log file. This can help to protect your data in case of system crashes.After you have configured the partition, click \"Start\" to begin formatting the partition. This process can take a few minutes, depending on the size of the partition and the speed of your hard drive. Once the formatting is complete, your new partition will be ready to use.In conclusion, formatting a hard drive for Windows 10 is a straightforward process. By using the Disk Management utility, you can create partitions on your drive and format them with the desired file system. Understanding the basics of disk formatting is essential for any computer user, and this article has provided a comprehensive guide to help you get started.If you are interested in learning more about Windows 10, I encourage you to visit my blog at [Link] where I share tips and tricks for getting the most out of your computer.

            "<s> I'm in the process of choosing a new computer, and I'm seeking advice on selecting the most suitable operating system. Factors such as performance, user interface, and software compatibility are crucial considerations for me. Any suggestions on which operating system would meet these criteria?By MickMSunnyvale, CA USAI have a Lenovo T430s running Ubuntu. The T430s can be picked up for $249 now (used) on eBay. You would probably find the T420s on sale as well.That should work out to around $150 for the operating system and the laptop combined. I bought a 500GB SATA drive for the same model for under $20 at Microcenter last week. I am installing Ubuntu Server as a guest on VMware on my T430s.Edited February 10, 2019 by MickMOn 1/21/2019 at 9:45 AM, MickM said:I'm in the process of choosing a new computer, and I'm seeking advice on selecting the most suitable operating system.

It is very well specced, so will run the latest applications, with the added benefit that it will work great on a desktop. It has a lovely touch screen, so it can double up as a tablet too. A great price/performance balance. I've got the i5 model, and it's really good.@MickM Hi, Mick, welcome to TalkComputing. There are a lot of different choices available on the market for your needs, and it depends on what you need to do with it. I personally use Windows 10 on all of my systems, but then again, my uses are different than many others. I have not used Ubuntu or Linux Mint on any of my computers, but I know they run great. So, your choices may be Linux, Windows, or Mac. Personally, I like the iMac for aesthetic and performance reasons. For the best in performance, you may have to look at the i9 processors, although the i7 has plenty of power and uses less power than the i9. I am sure you have already considered RAM, and there are different memory chips that are faster than others, and they make a huge difference. You could also add an SSD if you need to for a faster boot and load time. I suggest looking at the 3.8GHz 8 core and the 3.0GHz 6 core models of the 27\u201d iMacs, but there are others available, too. You will get great performance and looks. Good luck with your choice!On 2/11/2019 at 7:57 AM, Dudley said:I'm using the Surface Pro 6 for portability. I do everything with it.I have a Surface Pro 4 for portability, and have for years. I like it so much, I actually have two! One is connected to an external monitor, the other has a small keyboard attached. It's a bit larger than the i5, and has more power. However, I have never found a need for the i9. I have an i7, and it is still more than sufficient. I'm not saying you should or should not buy one, I'm just telling you what works for me. I have the 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD. That is more than enough for anything I would do. I am sure the 1920 x 1200 screen is great, but the 1920 x 1080 is great for me. I'm sure you will find the right balance for you.Thanks to everyone who offered advice and suggestions. I\u2019m leaning toward the Surface Pro 7.As far as choosing a computer for a home office, I find that performance, security and ease of use are crucial. I want a system that is both secure and fast. I don\u2019t want to worry about spyware or malware infecting my system.I prefer to use a Windows computer, but I\u2019m considering the new Mac Mini as an option. I\u2019ve heard great things about the M1 processor.Also, I\u2019d like to have a laptop that is lightweight, portable, and easy to use. I\u2019m not sure if I want a touchscreen, so I\u2019m still debating that.Any recommendations on a good laptop/tablet hybrid? I'm interested in the Surface Pro 8.I'm looking for a powerful computer that won't break the bank. I'm considering a refurbished MacBook Pro.

However, they may not be as user-friendly or come with as much pre-installed software.When it comes to performance, each operating system has its own strengths and weaknesses. Windows and macOS tend to be more user-friendly, but they can also be slower and require more resources. Linux and BSD, on the other hand, are often more lightweight and faster, but can be more complex to use.When it comes to compatibility, each operating system also has its own strengths and weaknesses. Windows and macOS are both widely compatible with a variety of software and hardware, but they can be more expensive. Linux and BSD, on the other hand, are often free to use, but they can be more difficult to find software and drivers for.Overall, it's important to carefully consider your needs and preferences when choosing an operating system. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, so be sure to research each operating system and determine which one is the best fit for you.Also, when shopping for a new computer, it's important to consider other factors beyond the operating system, such as processor speed, RAM, storage, and graphics capabilities.Thank you for your insights! In addition to the factors you mentioned, I'm also considering the ecosystem of apps available for each operating system.

Some operating systems are better at protecting against these threats than others.Ultimately, the operating system you choose should be based on your specific needs and preferences. If you have specific software or applications that you need to use, it might be worth considering those factors as well.For performance, the latest operating system will always be the most optimized, however, if you are working on a budget, you can opt for the most compatible operating system for your hardware. It's important to keep in mind that older operating systems may not support the latest software and applications.As for user interface, each operating system has its own unique features that can be appealing to different users. For example, Windows is known for its easy-to-use Start menu, while MacOS has a sleek and intuitive design.Compatibility with software applications can vary depending on the operating system. Some software may be exclusive to certain operating systems, while others may have a wider range of compatibility. It's important to check the requirements of any software you plan to use to ensure it will work on your chosen operating system.When it comes to security, operating systems like Windows and MacOS have robust security features to protect against malware and viruses. However, it's still important to practice safe computing habits like updating your software and being cautious when downloading files from the internet.In summary, the best operating system for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you are looking for the most optimized performance, the latest operating system is the way to go. However, if you are working on a budget, you can opt for the most compatible operating system for your hardware. It's also important to consider the user interface and compatibility with software applications when making your decision.</s>",

I'm interested in your insights on which operating system would be a great fit, taking into consideration performance, user interface, and compatibility with a variety of software applications.Here is the deal, for the most part.I have been working with computers for quite some time and have worked with nearly every operating system out there.The thing is, I don't believe that any of the operating systems out there really offer a \"great fit\" in the market. This is because the operating system is not actually the most important part of the system.That said, I would recommend Windows.Yes, I am a big Windows fan.If you're an Apple fan, then get a Mac.If you're a Linux fan, then get a Linux machine.If you're into Chromebooks, then get a Chromebook.If you're into the cloud, then get whatever you want (there is no \"best\" here).My point is, the operating system is just one of many factors. The rest are what you do with it, how you use it. If you want to write software, then get Windows. If you're a gamer, then get Windows or a gaming console. If you're an engineer, then get Windows. If you're into cloud computing, then get whatever you want.I can't really think of an operating system that stands out as great for every use case. Every one of them is just a set of tools to use for a specific purpose.In short, there is no \"best\" operating system, just like there is no \"best\" computer for the same reason.What type of

            "<s> Considering the purchase of a new computer, I find myself uncertain about the best operating system for my needs. Could you provide recommendations based on factors like performance, user interface, and compatibility with different software applications?In the current computing environment, most personal computers are equipped with either a Macintosh or Microsoft operating system. For some, the choice may be simple: Macintosh computers tend to be favored by the creative and design industries, while PCs are more frequently chosen by the financial and business sectors. For those who are undecided, though, there are a number of different factors to consider. To help make the decision a bit easier, this guide will provide a comparison of the two most popular operating systems based on key features.One of the most significant differences between a Macintosh and a PC is the user interface. For example, Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system features a Start menu that enables the user to select and launch any applications with ease. In comparison, a Macintosh user can select from a number of different applications located within the Dock, a bar that is displayed at the bottom of the screen. The Dock contains shortcuts for launching applications and documents, as well as system utilities such as iTunes. Furthermore, the Dock can be customized to suit each user\u2019s preferences and needs.When selecting a computer, it is also important to consider the hardware specifications. PCs tend to be more affordable, and they offer a wide range of configurations that are suitable for both home and professional use.
