In all honesty, this is the only hotel I've ever been to that had a clean bathroom.posted by kaydee at 8:52 AM on October 1, 2008 [1 favorite]I love staying at a Sheraton, although the ones in Europe seem to be better than the ones in the States.I'm also very partial to the Radisson because they have the best bedding. I once stayed in a Radisson in Boston because I wanted to try out the bedding and then didn't want to leave. I think there was an ice storm on the second night but I didn't care.posted by peagood at 8:53 AM on October 1, 2008Most hotels will offer a breakfast for a fee of $8 or so, and you'll get something you can eat.The chain I tend to favor is Hilton. They're pretty consistent throughout the world, I don't think I've ever had a problem with any hotel I stayed in and they have a breakfast.posted by cjorgensen at 8:54 AM on October 1, 2008Response by poster: Thanks for the responses! We're definitely budget-conscious, but not down-and-out enough to go for motels.We're talking about hotels in the 50-100 range in price, not 200 or more.posted by jessamyn at 8:55 AM on October 1, 2008I've been a fan of Wingate inns for a long time. I stayed in a lot of their hotels when I was traveling and never had a bad experience.posted by 8dot3 at 8:57 AM on October 1, 2008Response by poster: This sounds like a job for hotwire!I'm thinking the Wingate Inn, myself. I stayed at one in Birmingham and was very happy with it.posted by kozad at 9:00 AM on October 1, 2008Best Western, and I like the ones in the US.posted by dgran at 9:01 AM on October 1, 2008I stayed at an Embassy Suites in Portland a couple of weeks ago and it was very nice. They have a good, complimentary breakfast, the rooms are spacious, the kitchen was well equipped and the service was great. There were free shuttles that took you to the Pearl District or to the downtown shopping area.posted by waving at 9:03 AM on October 1, 2008Best Western's Penn Plaza in San Francisco is good. I've also stayed at a Wyndham hotel (the one on O'Farrell and Lombard) that was also fine.posted by tiger tiger at 9:04 AM on October 1, 2008The Hampton Inn is pretty good. In the US. In Europe they suck, so I can't comment there.The Radisson sucks here in the US, but I have no idea how it is in Europe.The Crowne Plaza sucks, except for the one I stayed in in Munich, which was nice.I've only stayed at a Holiday Inn in the US, and I have no idea how they are elsewhere.The Red Roof Inn is kind of like a motel, but not quite. I've stayed at a few and they were okay.The Hyatt Regency in Boston is pretty decent.I've never stayed at a Doubletree.The Hyatt is pretty good in Japan.posted by bobboage at 9:05 AM on October 1, 2008Response by poster: We're mostly in Europe, though.I'm a big fan of the Holiday Inn brand.posted by gfrobe at 9:06 AM on October 1, 2008The Holiday Inn in Portland is really nice.Response by poster: I think I'll look at hotwire for a place in Paris.I like Wingate hotels, particularly in DC and NYC. But the hotwire site will be helpful no matter where you end up.Seconding the Radisson in Europe, I've been in three in Germany and all were fine.Also, the hotels in Germany are so cheap that if you have to pay more than about 100 euros a night it's worth paying the extra for a nice place to sleep.I'd pick a good European brand that you've already stayed in. If you're in London, I'd suggest the Radisson or the Novotel.If it were me, I'd probably just go to Orbitz and look for a cheap room in Paris. I'm guessing there are several good brands there that you'd like, and I don't think you'll pay that much. (And if you do, it's probably worth the extra money)posted by DU at 9:16 AM on October 1, 2008Might I add a caveat? There was a hotel in my home town that I loved, and we visited there once every year. And then, one day, they got bought out by a company that sucked. And everything was crappy after that.(I don't remember the name of the company or which hotel it was, unfortunately.)posted by zennie at 9:17 AM on October 1, 2008Radisson in Germany is great. There was one in Frankfurt, I believe, that was very nice. I had some bad experiences at the Holiday Inn, though.If you want to stay in a hotel brand, my favorite was the Hilton, and my least favorite was the Hyatt, but maybe that's a function of how I felt about the cities.posted by zizzy at 9:17 AM on October 1, 2008The Hyatt Centric in Brussels, Belgium is pretty decent. I don't know if it's owned by the same folks as the one in Boston.

We always go to hotels like that when I travel. I've never had a bad experience. They're inexpensive and clean.I've never been to a Holiday Inn or a Hyatt Regency that I liked. They're always a bit too expensive and/or dumpy and/or not clean.posted by jeremias at 9:25 AM on October 1, 2008I've been to 25 cities in 24 countries in the last 2 years and stayed at hundreds of hotels. If you need some suggestions of places to start, email me.posted by jimmythefish at 9:25 AM on October 1, 2008Holiday Inn Express in NYC and Chicago are great. The hotel is part of the same group, which also owns Candlewood Suites, another option for travelers who aren't interested in the 4 star-type hotel experience.posted by k8t at 9:28 AM on October 1, 2008The Radisson in Munich was amazing, by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at, but that might be a function of how much I paid.Response by poster: Munich!The Wingate Inn in Dallas was good for business travel, and very inexpensive for a hotel.posted by TheBones at 9:34 AM on October 1, 2008Hyatt Place in Atlanta was really nice and really cheap. (That is to say, really cheap compared to other midrange hotels in the Atlanta area.)posted by aubilenon at 9:36 AM on October 1, 2008Best Western Plus in San Jose, CA.

And it's very reasonable priced.posted by shinyanni at 9:47 AM on October 1, 2008Response by poster: The Waldorf in NYC, I think, is a step or two above midrange.The Radisson Blu in Berlin (Mitte, near Kurf\u00fcrstendamm) was great.posted by cimbrog at 9:51 AM on October 1, 2008Mercure hotels.posted by SassHat at 9:56 AM on October 1, 2008The Hilton in Frankfurt was great, and the Hilton in Reykjavik, too.posted by madcaptenor at 10:04 AM on October 1, 2008I love the Hyatt in London.

A very nice hotel that's in the heart of the city.I'd suggest Hotwire as well - I've found it to be very reliable.posted by The_Awakener at 10:40 AM on October 1, 2008I don't think you'll find any hotels of any brand, or any travel websites for that matter, that have consistently excellent service.Response by poster: Maybe not in the States, but I'm looking for hotels where we'll be returning, and I suspect the service at some places will be better than others.posted by jessamyn at 10:41 AM on October 1, 2008 [1 favorite]Response by poster: My mistake! It was the Holiday Inn in Paris that was great!You're right - there is no such thing. It's like \"where is the best place to eat?\" - it depends what you like and what your budget is.I'm going to disagree with the Hilton in Reykjavik, IMO. I found the staff to be extremely incompetent. I'm sure it could have been a bad night but in my experience the staff in the Icelandic Hilton were very unhelpful.posted by cimbrog at 11:24 AM on October 1, 2008If you're looking for consistency, I would suggest a big chain, which I believe is what you're looking for. Midrange hotels are a hard find. You want to look for a chain and a city that has a consistent reputation. Hilton, Marriott, Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza, and Hyatt come to mind.Response by poster: I've done the big-chain thing in Europe, and in some cases the rooms are pretty small and the service leaves a lot to be desired.I'm looking for hotels that are pretty consistently good - that's why we're looking at a brand.I'd recommend the Hyatt Place in Cambridge, MA. It's very nice, and the breakfast buffet is excellent.posted by Kafkaesque at 11:57 AM on October 1, 2008I stay at the Marriott and Sheraton when traveling. I've never had any issues with them.posted by lampoil at 12:01 PM on October 1, 2008I stayed at a Marriott in Portland a couple of years ago, and was disappointed.posted by cerebus19 at 12:15 PM on October 1, 2008I've been to France, England, Ireland, and the Netherlands in the last two years and have stayed in dozens of hotels.My experience is that Europe is a much better value in terms of hotel room space, quality of service, and cost than the USA.You can expect to pay double to quadruple as much for a hotel room in the USA, and get half the quality of room, if that, in terms of space and amenities.In my experience, Europe is much more competitive, so you may want to rethink your criteria for the type of hotel you're looking for.For example, I've stayed at a Clarion hotel in London a couple of times and found the staff to be unfriendly, impersonal, and not well-trained. I've also stayed at a Clarion in Rotterdam and thought it was excellent. I've stayed at a Best Western in London, and the room was tiny and the bed felt like a rock, but the staff was great.When you go to Europe, I'd recommend you avoid hotels in the city centers and consider hotels in suburban neighborhoods. It's cheaper, and you'll have more peace and quiet and space. The hotels you want to avoid are in city centers, because there's too much competition and they're overpriced. There are also too many of these hotels, so the quality of service is not very good. And finally, the neighborhoods in the city centers have too much crime and bad traffic.I recommend that you rent an apartment instead of staying in a hotel room, if at all possible. There are plenty of apartment vacation rentals on the Internet. You can search Google for \"apartments\" + the name of the city you're going to, and you'll find plenty of results.For example, if you're going to Paris, you can find apartment vacation rentals for 100 euros a night, if you're willing to search. I once stayed at an apartment near the Notre Dame that had two bedrooms and two bathrooms, and it cost 130 euros a night, or 260 euros a week.posted by Brian B. at 12:21 PM on October 1, 2008 [1 favorite]I second The Holiday Inn, in particular the one in Portland, OR.posted by zippy at 12:41 PM on October 1, 2008I",

            "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate mid-range hotel chain that strikes a balance between reasonable pricing, comfortable accommodations, and consistent service standards? My criteria include a 100-plus-room property, an average stay of 3 or 4 nights, free internet access, and free in-room coffee. I don't need a fitness center or breakfast, so I can skip those extras. Any suggestions?I've found the Residence Inn chain to be consistent with service and accommodations.

I've been thinking about buying airline frequent flier miles. How do frequent flier miles work?I've been traveling to New York City since the late 1980s, and I've found that the best way to save money is to be flexible with your travel dates. That doesn't mean you have to be ready to fly on any given day, but you can choose the week, month, and even year that's the cheapest to fly to New York. You can also search and compare prices at multiple airlines with an aggregator site like Kayak.com.I just returned from the Tahitian Islands, and the trip was a lot of fun. While I was there, I picked up a Polynesian-style sarong, and I was curious if I would be allowed to bring it back home.

This is helpful when you're trying to decide whether an airfare offer is too good to pass up. Just don't confuse this site with the airline site itself, which often gives the cheapest fare as the first option.In 2015, I flew on several airlines and used two different credit cards for the frequent flyer mileage accrual. I'm curious if there's a benefit to using one card over another. Which card should I choose?I've always found that it's better to have multiple credit cards rather than one, because it gives you a better chance of receiving the best deal possible with any given airline or hotel. Each airline and hotel chain has its own loyalty program, so it's helpful to be able to earn miles and points from each company. That way, you can accrue miles from multiple companies to maximize the number of miles you can use. Just be sure to pay off your credit card balance in full every month, so you don't rack up too many credit card fees and interest charges.We're looking to book a beach vacation, and my wife and I are having a hard time deciding what would be best for our needs.

The condo is also more privately owned, so it's often cheaper than a hotel.What are some tips for saving money on a family vacation?My family and I want to take a trip next summer, but we're on a budget.

This chain is a mid-scale hotel with locations that have 100 rooms or less. These locations are also known for having breakfasts included with your stay.I stayed in the Ibis Hotel in Strasbourg, France recently and enjoyed the following:Modern hotel with rooms that were clean and comfortable.A small breakfast area where guests ate in a casual atmosphere with their morning cup of coffee.The hotel was in a prime location where guests could easily explore the area.Overall, I enjoyed my stay in this hotel and believe you could enjoy it as well.</s>",

I'm travelling across America in November and would like to be confident that wherever I end up I'll be able to trust the company. I'm looking for recommendations for an established company rather than an individual hotel.We like mid-range chains, but many are either too expensive for us, or too cheap. So we'll look at one in the middle. We like the Best Western chain, and have stayed in several of their hotels and found them to be very comfortable, clean, and well-managed. They're all standardized to a certain point (you know what to expect when you walk in the door), but are different from one another in many other ways. Some are large chains, some are individual owners or partnerships. They all have a good reputation. Some are more high-end and some are less so. Some have a great pool, some don't. Some are in nice locations, others are a little tucked away. Some are family friendly, some are not. Some have very spacious rooms, some are a little small. It's up to you to pick the ones that you like best. There are even some that we would call \"high-end\" at $100+ a night, and some that are \"budget\" at $50-75. But for the most part, we've always found Best Western to be the best value for the money.There are some other \"mid-range\" chains that we'd recommend if we liked one of their hotels, but we don't think they've standardized enough to give us the same level of consistency as Best Western. So in general, Best Western is our \"go to\" chain for the middle-price range hotels.Comments for Can you recommend the ultimate mid-range hotel chain that strikes a balance between reasonable pricing, comfortable accommodations, and consistent service standards?BW is no longer my favorite.We recently stayed in the Best Western Sunny Isles Hotel, Miami. I have stayed in a lot of Best Western hotels in my travels. We had a major problem during the booking process with this hotel. Once we got there and we finally got our room (we had to wait for it) it was a very small room. We were put into a room with a shower that leaked and the toilet was broken. The hotel was very far from the beach. I have stayed in much better mid range hotels. Best Western is no longer my favorite hotel chain to stay at.There's a very good Best Western in Bend, OR that we've stayed in and have also recommended to others.</s>"

            "<s> I'm curious to know your preference for the mid-range hotel chain that stands out in terms of providing value for money, standard amenities, and a reliable guest experience. My choice is Choice Hotels.My wife and I spent a lot of time on the road in 2011, in our quest to visit all 50 states (and DC) within 12 months. While our budget did not extend to high-end lodgings at high-end chains, we nevertheless sought the best hotel experience within the price range we were willing to pay. As a result, we became quite accustomed to many hotel brands that are generally classified as mid-range. We visited properties belonging to Choice Hotels International, Inc. (NYSE:CHH), Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:WYN), Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE:HOT), Hilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT), InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (NYSE:IHG), and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H).We were very comfortable at properties operated by Choice, and we were particularly fond of their Econolodge brand. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and they offered all the amenities we required. Most notably, we really appreciated the inclusion of the free breakfast option in the room rate.

            "<s> I'm curious to know your preference for the mid-range hotel chain that stands out in terms of providing value for money, standard amenities, and a reliable guest experience. Is it the Holiday Inn or the Hampton Inn?The quality of a hotel can make or break a vacation. With a wide variety of hotel chains and brands, guests can choose from luxury five-star hotels to value-for-money chains. Two such brands, Holiday Inn and Hampton Inn, offer affordable, comfortable, and convenient accommodation with a range of amenities. However, which one is better?The Holiday Inn brand was founded in 1952, and the company has grown to become one of the most recognizable hotel brands in the world. With its distinctive sign, bright colors, and comfortable rooms, the Holiday Inn brand stands out as a trusted hotel choice.The Hampton Inn brand, on the other hand, was founded in 1984 and has quickly become a popular hotel chain, offering a range of amenities and services. While the Holiday Inn brand has been around longer, the Hampton Inn brand is known for its consistent quality and friendly staff.When it comes to the quality of their rooms, both the Holiday Inn and the Hampton Inn offer comfortable and clean rooms with a range of amenities. Both chains have a commitment to providing guests with a high-quality stay, including clean sheets, fresh towels, and comfortable beds.In terms of price, the Holiday Inn and the Hampton Inn both offer affordable room rates, with prices starting at around $80 per night. The Holiday Inn is slightly more expensive than the Hampton Inn, with room rates averaging $90 per night. However, the higher price may be worth it for guests who value the extra amenities and services offered by the Holiday Inn brand.Overall, both the Holiday Inn and the Hampton Inn offer great quality and value for money. However, if you're looking for a more affordable option, the Hampton Inn may be the better choice.It really depends on your preferences. The Holiday Inn offers the advantage of being a well-established and trusted brand, but it may also be more expensive. The Hampton Inn, on the other hand, is more affordable, but may not have as many amenities.</s>",

Hyatt Place hotels are an upper-midscale brand that is an extension of the upscale Hyatt Regency brand. This is a global brand that is part of the Hyatt hotel group that has 1,445 properties worldwide, with 574 located in the US alone.The Hyatt Place brand is a solid mid-range brand that offers an excellent guest experience. In my experience, they provide good standard amenities and services, and a reasonable cost-to-value ratio.Hyatt Place hotels are a bit of a middle ground. You get some of the nicer aspects of high-end hotels and a few of the amenities and services of a budget hotel.For example, Hyatt Place hotels typically have free breakfast, a large pool, on-site restaurant and bar, an exercise facility, a business center, free Wi-Fi, a large conference room for business meetings, and a free snack center with a limited selection of snacks. You get some of the comfort and luxury of a high-end hotel without the price tag.Another plus to Hyatt Place hotels is that they're located in urban areas, which means there are more businesses and other services nearby.One area where Hyatt Place hotels lack a bit is that the rooms are typically smaller than those in a luxury hotel. This is due to the cost-cutting measures that have become common in the mid-range hotel market. It's worth noting that Hyatt Place hotels typically charge an extra premium for a room with a larger size.Another point worth mentioning is that not all Hyatt Place hotels offer the same amenities. For example, the Hyatt Place hotels in Canada don't have a free breakfast. In the US, there's typically a different level of service for every market. Some Hyatt Place hotels have nicer rooms and more amenities than others.When deciding on a Hyatt Place hotel, it's always worth checking out reviews online. This is especially true for any hotel that has just opened.All in all, I think Hyatt Place hotels are an excellent mid-range option that offers value for money, standard amenities, and a reliable guest experience. They're well-located, have good amenities, and are usually a bit more affordable than a luxury hotel.The 20 Best Mid-Range Hotels in TorontoThe 10 Best Mid-Range Hotels in Chicago</s>",

It is very affordable, and the quality of the room is usually pretty good.The problem with this chain is their service. They are only open during business hours, and you have to call to make a reservation. There are only two locations in my town, but they both look decent and seem to be maintained fairly well.I've also stayed at the Howard Johnson's, and the rooms are bigger and nicer than Motel 6, but the service is not as good.The third option I've tried is Hampton Inn. This place is really nice, but it is pretty expensive. The rooms are smaller than the others, but they have a nice pool area and a great breakfast.I'd recommend any of these hotels for someone who is looking for a good place to stay on a budget.Motel 6 is probably the most well-known chain. It's a great value for the money, but it can be hit or miss in terms of quality. The rooms are usually clean and well-maintained, but sometimes they're in need of some repair work.The service is decent, but it can be slow at times. The front desk is open 24 hours a day, and there's always someone around to help if you need it. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and they'll try to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.The food is basic and not always the best, but it's edible and sometimes tasty. The rooms are decent, but they're not exactly luxurious. The bathrooms are usually clean, but they can be dirty sometimes.Motel 6 is a decent place to stay if you're on a budget or just looking for a cheap place to stay while traveling.I've stayed in both Motel 6 and Howard Johnson's. They are both decent hotels, but I would prefer to stay at Howard Johnson's because it's more comfortable and less noisy.The quality of the service is also much better at Howard Johnson's, so I would recommend staying there if you have a choice.The prices at both hotels are about the same, but I think the quality of service and the comfort of the rooms are better at Howard Johnson's.The Hampton Inn is a bit pricier than Motel 6, but it is definitely worth the extra money. The rooms are very comfortable, the service is friendly and helpful, and the breakfast is excellent.The only downside is that there is no pool on-site, but the nearby beach is great for swimming. Overall, the Hampton Inn is a fantastic hotel for families or couples looking for a comfortable, affordable place to stay.The Motel 6 is the best of the three hotels I have stayed in.It's clean, the staff is friendly, and the beds are comfortable.The Howard Johnson's is a close second.

That said, I'd also like to hear your personal experience with each one.For my part, I've always had a soft spot for Choice hotels. They've always been reasonably priced, comfortable, and generally speaking have been well-run properties with a nice staff.I also enjoy a Holiday Inn as well. I have always found them to be reliable, comfortable, and good value for money.Anyway, this is just a casual survey to see what the general consensus is, if any.Aloha and happy travels, everyone!I have always enjoyed La Quinta Hotels, but that is all they have in my area.When I was growing up we went to Hawaii every year, the first hotel we stayed at when we got there was always Holiday Inn and I can remember always enjoying it.I have not stayed at a Marriott in ages, but as I remember them they were always pretty nice.I haven't really stayed at any other chain hotel in a long time.I really like the Red Roof Inn chain.

The location was good and the price was great. I have heard that the chain is a great one to stay at for your first trip, as it tends to be on a standard.I used to be a big fan of Holiday Inns, but for the last year or so they have been really trying to get me to stay at their new Holiday Inn Express, which is only in business class hotels now.I'm not sure why, because I always found that they were the same quality as the regular Holiday Inns. They used to get a lot of business from me, but for the last year I haven't been able to find one close enough to where I was staying to make it worth it.I have stayed at Choice hotels. They are all very similar to each other. I find it a little difficult to tell the differences at times.I have stayed at Choice Hotels, the brand doesn't really matter to me. I just like their prices and they are always pretty clean.I don't remember the names of any of the hotels that I've stayed in, but I do know that I've had good experiences at most of them.I stay at Choice Hotels because they are consistently nice, friendly and professional.

            "<s> In your view, which mid-range hotel chain distinguishes itself by offering excellent results in terms of affordability, quality accommodations, and a positive overall stay?We can\u2019t think of one. We\u2019ve traveled widely with many hotel chains and many mid-range chains. We\u2019ve found that many of them are good and some of them are very good. But we\u2019ve never come across a mid-range hotel chain that has truly exceptional facilities, a consistently excellent quality of service, and reasonable prices.Our own favorite hotels are generally boutique hotels and, even among these, we can find some that fall short of expectations. But they are exceptions.We do have a few suggestions if you want to stay in a more upscale chain. We think Hyatt Hotels, InterContinental, and Marriott are good options. Of these, Marriott has the most consistent quality and we prefer Hyatt.But if you are looking for a mid-range hotel, we would suggest avoiding them altogether. Instead, look for a quality boutique hotel. We believe that boutique hotels are the best place to stay for both comfort and value.Is there a particular country or city where you believe it is worth paying extra for a mid-range hotel?No, we don\u2019t think so. There are some wonderful boutique hotels in both cities and countries. They are not mid-range, but we can\u2019t think of a city that isn\u2019t worth staying at a mid-range hotel for.What other sources do you use for finding mid-range hotels?We read reviews on TripAdvisor. We also use the web sites of some mid-range hotel chains. These web sites are usually pretty good, but sometimes not. We don\u2019t use the hotels themselves. If you\u2019re booking with Expedia, Booking.com, or other online travel agents, we recommend reading the reviews carefully. They will often contain negative comments about the hotel. We also recommend that you read the hotel\u2019s web site. The reviews are often misleading or the hotel\u2019s web site is just flat-out wrong.Why do you choose not to use your own experience of staying at mid-range hotels to provide advice?There are a number of reasons. We have only limited experience staying at hotels. We stay at a very limited number of hotels each year. When we do, we tend to stay at boutique hotels. It is much harder to make a decision about a hotel\u2019s quality when you only have limited information.We also have a tendency to be a bit too fussy. We find that we are often too quick to criticize a hotel that is simply not as good as we would like it to be. We also tend to be a bit picky about what we are looking for in a hotel. We prefer boutique hotels that have character and a unique atmosphere. We find that the mid-range chains that we encounter are generally lacking in these qualities.Finally, we tend to not like staying at mid-range hotels. They are not very comfortable, the service is not very good, and they are not very exciting.So while we may have some experience staying at mid-range hotels, we don\u2019t believe that our experience should be used to provide advice on where to stay.Which mid-range hotel chain provides the most value for money?It\u2019s a hard question to answer, as there are so many factors that go into determining what\u2019s the best value for money.

            "<s> When considering mid-range hotel chains, which one do you believe excels in providing a satisfying guest experience with features like accessible pricing, standard amenities, and a reputation for reliability? How about the ability to reward loyalty and frequent travel with benefits? IHG\u2019s new loyalty program, IHG Rewards Club, has all these features.We\u2019re very familiar with the brand. I\u2019ve stayed at a number of its hotels in the U.S., but this is my first experience with an IHG hotel outside the States.I recently traveled to New Zealand, and because the InterContinental Auckland (one of the hotels in the chain) was conveniently located, I stayed there for two nights.A short stay in New Zealand may not seem like a big deal to some, but for me it was a big deal. Why?I have had a bucket list of things to do and places to visit since 1997, and it includes New Zealand. I\u2019ve wanted to experience the natural beauty, the Maori culture, the food, and of course, the adventure. As I\u2019ve written before, I\u2019ve traveled more in the last three years than I did in the previous 30 years. I\u2019ve been able to knock some big items off of the list. New Zealand, however, remained on the list.I knew I had to get to New Zealand. So, I got on a plane and booked a ticket for a two-week trip to Australia and New Zealand. I wanted to start at the bottom and work my way up. And so, I ended up in the very southern tip of New Zealand\u2019s South Island and made my way to Christchurch, the largest city in the region.Then I made the mistake of trying to do everything in one trip. I wanted to experience as much of New Zealand as I could in two weeks. I rented a car (the first time I\u2019d ever rented a car anywhere in the world) and drove from Christchurch up the island and through the mountains on a winding, narrow road to Queenstown on the other side of the island.I drove to Milford Sound (one of the most picturesque destinations in New Zealand, and one of the most popular), and I drove back to Christchurch. It was 2,500 miles and took me 15 hours to complete. I was so excited to be in New Zealand, but the stress of driving 2,500 miles in 15 hours took the joy out of the experience.I was exhausted. I needed to rest. I needed to unwind.Enter IHG Rewards Club.I chose the InterContinental Auckland because of its location, proximity to the airport, and the availability of a suite with two bathrooms, which made it possible for me to do more than just sleep, relax, and unwind.The room was clean and comfortable, and my suite was nicely appointed. I could walk to the shops and restaurants within the hotel complex and easily walk to the beach. IHG Rewards Club provided complimentary continental breakfast. The staff was friendly and helpful, and I felt welcome at the hotel.I earned 12 points per dollar on my stay, and I was awarded a complimentary breakfast, which included a choice between a traditional hot breakfast or a cold breakfast buffet, and a bottle of wine upon checkout. The complimentary breakfast and the bottle of wine weren\u2019t necessarily needed, but they were welcome. The complimentary breakfast wasn\u2019t just a token of appreciation; it also provided a few more IHG Rewards Club points.With a simple visit to a hotel, I earned enough IHG Rewards Club points to make the hotel stay free, along with an extra night for a weekend stay. My only wish was that I\u2019d had more time to enjoy the Auckland hotel and more points to work with.My New Zealand experience has reconfirmed a few things. I love traveling to exotic, remote locations. I enjoy learning about new cultures, seeing natural wonders, and trying new foods. I enjoy experiencing the different hotels I stay in, and I want to get to New Zealand again to see more of the South Island and the North Island. I also enjoy earning IHG Rewards Club points, which I use to stay at IHG hotels, like the InterContinental Auckland.Have you been to New Zealand?

            "<s> When considering mid-range hotel chains, which one do you believe excels in providing a satisfying guest experience with features like accessible pricing, standard amenities, and a reputation for reliability?Hilton, Marriott, IHG, Wyndham, or Choice?This is not a trick question, but it may seem like one. The hotel industry is littered with brands that are focused on a single service offering. This creates a significant advantage for chains with broad offerings.For instance, you could make an argument that Hilton has the best branding in the industry. Hilton\u2019s offerings range from standard economy to luxury. They also operate in virtually every geographic area of the globe.Therefore, when you need a hotel in Hawaii, they have you covered.But what about Choice?They have the best standard amenities of any mid-range hotel brand. You can be confident that their hotels will offer a quality pool, fitness center, and free breakfast.Wyndham offers the most diverse experience with nearly 7,000 hotels around the world. Therefore, if you\u2019re traveling for business and need a budget hotel room, you could rely on Wyndham.Would it be possible to make an argument that Choice is the best brand in the industry?Choice International has 7,000 hotels, the most of any hotel brand. It has an almost limitless selection of hotels in every region of the world. They even offer hotels that are exclusive to Choice.These exclusive hotels aren\u2019t the same as typical hotels; they\u2019re better. These hotels are often small and provide a unique experience. However, they\u2019re available to Choice members only.Choice International members also receive discounts on hotel bookings, including an exclusive 10% off. This is a significant discount that can save a guest hundreds of dollars.Choice also offers free breakfast, free wifi, and a free drink for every 3 nights you stay at a Choice hotel.Additionally, Choice hotels offer points for hotel bookings, which can be redeemed for free nights or other rewards. These points can be used to earn a free night in a Choice hotel, which can be valuable if you\u2019re looking to save money on a trip.Choice International has an incredible selection of hotels in every region of the world. The company is expanding its presence globally, so there\u2019s no shortage of places to stay. This provides Choice guests with an opportunity to save money and find the perfect place to stay.Choice International also offers a loyalty program that rewards guests for their loyalty.

            "<s> If you had to pinpoint the premier mid-range hotel chain, which one would it be, and what specific features contribute to its reputation as the top choice for a balanced and affordable stay? The answer to both of these questions is simple: the Comfort Inn chain. The chain has been around since 1981 and now boasts over 1,500 locations across North America, with another 250+ in the works in other regions of the world. In an effort to provide a more personal and unique experience for each and every guest, the company has also established over 60 Comfort Inn & Suites, with plans for an additional 200 by the year 2020. If you have not stayed in one of their properties before, or you haven't stayed at any Comfort Inn in quite some time, this article will provide you with the information and tips you need to make an informed decision for your next overnight stay.When comparing the Comfort Inn chain to other hotel chains, it's important to consider what type of hotel is most appropriate for your specific needs. While many chains offer a very similar experience for each of their locations, Comfort Inn actually provides four different options, with unique features for each.Comfort Inn - The original option, this chain is a great choice for anyone seeking a hotel with a great location. Since most Comfort Inn properties are located near interstate highways or downtown areas, they tend to be quite convenient and easily accessible.Comfort Inn & Suites - If you're looking for a hotel that offers both comfort and a full range of services, Comfort Inn & Suites is a great choice. With an additional 350 square feet of space available, this option offers amenities such as a full-service restaurant, workout room, and meeting spaces.Comfort Inn Express - For those who are looking for a more private and intimate setting for their stay, Comfort Inn Express is a great option. These smaller properties offer the same quality of comfort and service as the larger locations, just with fewer amenities.Comfort Inn Executive - With over 550 properties located in more than 25 different countries, Comfort Inn Executive is a truly global experience. With an emphasis on providing a top-notch experience, these locations often include extra amenities such as in-room coffee, free internet access, and on-site restaurants.Comfort Inn offers three different membership options: Comfort Inn Rewards, the Comfort Inn Rewards VIP program, and the My Rewards Plus program. Comfort Inn Rewards is the base membership level and is available to all guests. With this program, you earn points every time you stay at a Comfort Inn property and are then rewarded with extra amenities and services such as free breakfast, in-room coffee, and internet access. The Comfort Inn Rewards VIP program is designed specifically for frequent travelers and offers additional benefits such as priority check-in and exclusive rewards. Finally, the My Rewards Plus program is an all-inclusive membership option that provides extra benefits and rewards to those who stay at a Comfort Inn property 12 times or more per year.Each Comfort Inn property has its own distinctive look and feel, thanks in large part to the creative input of the hotel owner. For example, the Comfort Inn property located in Omaha, Nebraska is known for its rustic and natural feel, while the Comfort Inn & Suites property in Miami, Florida has a more contemporary and modern style. When considering which Comfort Inn location is right for you, it's important to do a little bit of research beforehand to find out exactly what each hotel offers.Once you've decided on a specific Comfort Inn location, it's important to understand the basic amenities that are typically offered at each property. This includes amenities such as on-site restaurant, free breakfast, and free wireless internet access. Of course, each property will have its own unique set of amenities and services, so it's important to do a little bit of research beforehand to find out exactly what each hotel offers.Comfort Inn also provides a range of services that guests can use to make their stay even more enjoyable. For example, each Comfort Inn location has a complimentary breakfast buffet available every morning, as well as an on-site restaurant that serves a variety of different dishes. Additionally, each property has a fitness center available for guests who want to stay active while on their trip. Finally, each property has a 24-hour front desk staff available to assist guests with any issues or questions that may arise during their stay.When you book your stay at a Comfort Inn location, you're guaranteed to get a high-quality experience every time. With over 1,500 different locations across North America, there's sure to be a Comfort Inn that's perfect for your next vacation or business trip.

            "<s> Seeking insights on the most commendable mid-range hotel chain \u2013 the one that truly sets the standard for providing a comfortable and affordable lodging experience without compromising on quality.I would like to give my honest feedback as a consumer. Please also take into account the fact that I have been travelling around the world since the age of 19 and stayed in hundreds of hotels, so my reviews are based on my extensive hotel-stay experiences and are not based on the \"premium-branded-hotel-lovers\" viewpoint.So I hope that will be helpful.@tibro: As you've said, it's all about value, right? So the answer is yes, most definitely - a mid-range hotel can be the best hotel on the planet if the value it provides is the right one. The \"value\" here is not the room rate, but the experience, service, facilities, and the value for money provided by all those mentioned above. It is a combination of factors. So a mid-range hotel chain that offers good value is also highly dependent on the location. For example, an Ibis in a remote town in France with no facilities is not going to offer the same value as an Ibis in a major city like New York or Paris.I've stayed at quite a few Ibis hotels and they are all clean and comfortable, but some are better than others. The one thing that I noticed is that they are not exactly cheap - if you stay at one in a major city, then expect to pay more or less the same as any other branded hotel in the area. I think the most important thing is the location, which is more relevant than any other brand. I've found Ibis to be good at what it does and have been impressed with the quality and consistency.The chain that stands out for me is Accor Hotels. They offer the widest range of hotels and the best location, and also have a reputation for having the best rooms, best service, and the best staff. They are also the most consistent and have the best food, so they are the top choice for me. The only thing I'd say is that the quality of the rooms and service can vary quite a bit from hotel to hotel, and I've had some bad experiences at Accor hotels. They can be pricey, but they are always worth it.My vote goes to Ibis as it provides the best value for money. I've stayed at many Ibis hotels and have been really impressed by the quality of the rooms, service, facilities, and value for money. The only downside is that they are not always the cheapest - if you stay at one in a major city, then expect to pay more or less the same as any other branded hotel in the area.

            "<s> Which mid-range hotel chain, based on your experience, surpasses others in delivering a positive stay, complete with affordable rates, essential amenities, and consistent service standards?The short answer is none, because no mid-range hotel chain surpasses others in delivering a positive stay, complete with affordable rates, essential amenities, and consistent service standards. Mid-range hotel chains are, to be sure, better than their competition, but they have their issues and no chain is perfect.Why do you say none?For one, there is no such thing as consistency. I\u2019ve written before about how inconsistent chains can be from hotel to hotel. Sure, there are standards, but as I\u2019ve seen countless times, some hotels fall far short of those standards. That is, some hotels fall far short of the standards at the hotel chain\u2019s headquarters.So if you have a stay at one hotel in the chain, and you didn\u2019t like it, that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t give the chain a chance at another hotel. For all you know, the one you didn\u2019t like was just an outlier and you should give the chain another chance. In which case, you would have a positive experience at a different hotel.And why would you expect any chain to be better than all others? That\u2019s absurd. I\u2019ve given you some examples in the past of this. For example, if you want the highest service standards, then Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton, and InterContinental are the best chains for that. And if you want the lowest rates, then Motel 6, Sleep Inn, Comfort Inn, and Red Roof Inn are the best.And what about the \u201cpositive stay\u201d part?You are right to point out that staying at a mid-range hotel chain is more than just the price. You are right. So you should take the time to research the chain to see if they have a decent track record with guests. If you look at reviews from the chain\u2019s own website, you will see how satisfied their guests are with their stay. That\u2019s where you should look.You may also want to check with an independent review site. These are the reviews you don\u2019t have to rely on the hotel for, because they don\u2019t need to advertise on their site. The reviews on independent review sites are often honest reviews written by guests who don\u2019t have any interest in the chain.Finally, take a look at the chain\u2019s website. Do they publish the reviews from guests? Do they respond to them? Do they have a clear customer service policy? These things can help you understand what to expect.In summary, I don\u2019t think any one mid-range hotel chain surpasses others in delivering a positive stay, complete with affordable rates, essential amenities, and consistent service standards. All of them are different, so you have to consider all the different factors before deciding which one is right for you.And if you don\u2019t want to decide, don\u2019t choose one. Just pick one hotel from each of the chain\u2019s hotel brands and try all of them. And if you don\u2019t like any of them, pick another chain and try them all. That way, you will know which chain is the best for you.And while we are on the subject, have you noticed that some of the hotel chains seem to be changing their logos lately? It\u2019s true. Many chains have updated their logos to reflect the changes in their service, the improvements they have made, and the changes in the way they are perceived. For example, many brands now have a \u201cfriendly\u201d look to them. Some have a \u201cfresh\u201d look, others have a \u201cclean\u201d look, and some even have a \u201cfun\u201d look. Some brands are even changing the color of their logos.So what do you think? Do you think that any mid-range hotel chain surpasses others in delivering a positive stay, complete with affordable rates, essential amenities, and consistent service standards?

            "<s> Which mid-range hotel chain, based on your experience, surpasses others in delivering a positive stay, complete with affordable rates, essential amenities, and consistent service standards?I had my first stay in a mid-range hotel in 1997. It\u2019s no longer in business, but I remember it as a clean, comfortable, no-frills hotel that offered a quiet, relaxing stay, not far from the heart of the city.Between that time and today, I\u2019ve been able to stay in a range of mid-range properties: from simple budget options with no in-room frills to modern, upscale hotels with spas and swimming pools. I\u2019ve sampled properties from the following brands:Travelodge (Canada)Wyndham (USA)Radisson (USA)Holiday Inn Express (USA)In my travels, I\u2019ve found that the most consistently good and comfortable stays in mid-range hotels have been with:In this survey, I\u2019d like to hear which mid-range hotel chain has delivered a great experience for you and why.

If you aren\u2019t feeling like the food offered, you can make a reservation at another restaurant, but it can be a hassle and quite disruptive.At Anantara Veli, they have a dining concept that provides for more flexibility. All the dining options are in a central area in front of the water so you can see other people dining while you eat. But they also serve you your choice of dishes from the entire menu at any table you wish. And you can order from multiple places at the same time, so you can enjoy the curry at the Thai table, the fish at the Japanese table, and the pasta at the Italian table.You can even order your choice of dessert. Their selection was quite limited, but you could choose to end the meal with a traditional Maldivian dessert or a classic like apple pie or cheesecake.This type of flexible dining is a refreshingly more relaxed experience. Instead of choosing a place and staying there, you can enjoy the entire dining options in front of you.Posted in: Best of the Maldives \\ Tagged: Anantara, best of, diningBest of the Maldives: Folding Stool \u2013 Kuda HuraaThis week\u2019s Best of the Maldives feature is something that you\u2019ll probably see on the beach, but may never know its name. The folding stool.These are a popular item that is very handy. A small, light stool, they fold up to very small size to easily pack in your suitcase or bag. When you sit on them, they feel solid, but they are very lightweight. The Kuda Huraa version folds out flat so you can set it on the floor or a wall.The only drawback is that you have to sit on your knees to do so (which may be a feature, not a bug, for some). But it\u2019s a very comfortable stool with lots of back support and solid frame. Perfect for a little garden chair or a place at the breakfast table.Tags: Best of the Maldives, Kuda Huraa, stoolBest of the Maldives: Gondola \u2013 Gili LankanfushiA gondola is a \u201cgondola\u201d. Just ask any Italian. They know their gondola. So does Gili Lankanfushi. And it is a gorgeous gondola.A gondola is a boat (or more precisely, a ship) with a very distinctive type of hull. It is a shallow, round-bottomed, V-shaped boat. So when you see one, you can easily recognize it. But unlike some of the gondolas I\u2019ve seen in the Maldives, it is not the standard tourist gondola. The one at Gili Lankanfushi is designed for two. I guess one gondola is a bit of an exaggeration. Two gondolas would be one gondolino. (OK, I\u2019ll stop the fun now. It\u2019s fun to say \u201cgondola\u201d, but it is actually more interesting in Italian.)The boat comes with the gondolier (or \u201cgondoliere\u201d) on the front. She steers with the two paddles on the sides. You glide through the canals of Gili Lankanfushi in a very quiet, intimate manner, and an excellent way to take in the views of the island and its sea life.The gondola is not the only vessel you can steer on Gili Lankanfushi. They also offer a sunset cruise aboard a pontoon boat.Posted in: Best of the Maldives \\ Tagged: boat, best of, Gili Lankanfushi, gondolaBest of the Maldives: Slide \u2013 LUX North Male AtollLast month I was able to get the scoop on one of the newest and most unique features of the new LUX resort opening up next month in North Male Atoll. Their pool is a \u201cwater-park\u201d with multiple pools including a water slide and a lazy river. Today, I\u2019m excited to show you the slide in all its glory.A great way to get a little thrill of speed and a big dose of relaxation all at once. If I\u2019m on vacation for more than a few days, I always seek out a pool with a slide so I can give it a good workout. It\u2019s good exercise and a nice change of pace from the usual pool pace.I always recommend to guests that they do the slide when it is quieter so that they can really appreciate the thrill of the ride. There\u2019s nothing like a slide when you can really get the hang of it. (I\u2019ve had some \u201cwater-park\u201d slides where it was quite an adventure even in calm conditions. I\u2019ve even tried to make friends with some people I\u2019ve met who had a rougher experience at one. It\u2019s always a little surreal to see the expression of complete terror on people as they go down the slide. \u201cOh, it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s actually a pretty good ride.\u201d I\u2019ve always had good luck and never had any real issues on the slides. But it\u2019s still funny to me that people think that they might die on a slide.)The LUX North Male Atoll slide is a very smooth, gentle ride. It is also very tall which gives it a lot of momentum as it races to the end. It\u2019s the perfect thrill ride!Posted in: Best of the Maldives \\ Tagged: best of, LUX North Male Atoll, pool, slideBest of the Maldives: Diving Safari \u2013 Huvafen FushiJuly 28, 2011 11:08 am \\ Leave a Comment \\ by bruceA dive safari is a common safari. Safari is a word that is used to describe any sort of journey or voyage. So a dive safari could be diving in a particular region (like a safari in India). It could be diving to particular places (like a safari to Victoria Falls). And it could be a dive to particular sights (like a safari to see the whale sharks in Mozambique).But the best type of dive safari is one where you don\u2019t have to decide where you\u2019ll dive or even which dive sites you\u2019ll visit. You simply pick up a guide at the resort, and he\u2019ll take you to the best sites for the day based on the conditions.At Huvafen Fushi, they offer this unique experience, but for land-lovers. They call it their Land Safari. Instead of diving the reef, you travel to different parts of the island where you can view the coral reef from the beach, glass bottom boat, or by snorkel.What a fun and relaxing way to enjoy your trip!Posted in: Best of the Maldives \\ Tagged: best of, Huvafen Fushi, safari</s>"

I'm a single male traveler, and my hotel experience isn't nearly as important to me as the location and cleanliness. What matters most to me is getting a comfortable place to sleep each night. I don't need to be pampered, just a clean room and good value for my money.I usually find myself traveling solo, which means the need for a hotel is pretty often, so a good balance between price and quality are extremely important. I like to get to a new place and start exploring right away, so I avoid downtown areas in favor of staying near the airport or someplace close to a bus/train/subway system.I'm leaning toward a Hilton brand (either the Hampton Inn or the Embassy Suites) due to the wide availability of their locations in my target areas. I'm wondering, however, if they're really living up to their name. Anyone have any advice on these two in particular?If you're looking for Hilton, Holiday Inn Express and Embassy Suites would be your best bet. There's a few newer ones out there like the new Holiday Inn Express and Suites which I stayed at. It was excellent value and clean and great breakfast with fresh coffee. They've all got great wifi and are pet friendly.I prefer the Holiday Inns and Holiday Expresses as they offer a free breakfast, and also provide free coffee.I have stayed at Hilton hotels, and they are not bad, but I really like the more moderately priced Holiday Inn Express. They usually have a nice indoor pool and workout facilities. There are many of these hotels all across the country, so you'll have no trouble finding one that is convenient to your travel destination.</s>",

If you want to be closer, you need to go to a more expensive hotel. Another option is Marriott. They have several brands including Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, SpringHill Suites and others. They're a little more expensive than Hampton Inn. What about a \"boutique\" hotel? If you want a boutique hotel that's affordable and convenient, I'd say Hilton Garden Inn is a great option. A lot of hotels in major metro areas are owned by a single chain and the amenities and service are pretty much the same everywhere you stay. So that doesn't really matter. You've got plenty of options in the mid-range that will offer a nice guest experience at an affordable price.What you are looking for is an extended stay hotel, that is a hotel that offers an extended stay.

I've stayed in a number of mid-range hotels in various parts of the United States. They were fine hotels. What are you looking for? If you have a specific location or an area you want to be in, it may be easier to answer the question. I'm in search of the top-notch mid-range hotel chain; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between affordability, convenience, and a consistently pleasant guest experience? In a major metro area with multiple airports, this is a much tougher question to answer than in a smaller city. The hotels at the major airports are going to be very expensive. So I'll assume you're not at an airport or a downtown area. One option is the Best Western, which is the largest hotel chain. They have a lot of mid-range hotels that are very pleasant and a lot of them are in major cities. But Best Western is just OK. It's not my first choice. My favorite is Hampton Inn and Suites, part of the Hilton chain. I've stayed in Hampton Inn and Suites around the world and always enjoyed it. In the US, the Hampton Inn is in the suburbs, not downtown. They are generally about 20 miles from downtown, but you'll get a free shuttle to the airport.

I'd also appreciate suggestions on a couple other hotel chains that offer the best of each of the three attributes I listed (in your opinion).Answer: Hilton is probably the biggest mid-scale chain, though not always. For instance, in Europe, the Hampton Inns are generally considered part of the mid-scale chain, but in North America, they're at the upper end.Answer: We stayed at the Embassy Suites last summer and it was great.Answer: I stay at a Hilton Garden Inn on my regular travel schedule and it's been an excellent experience.  They're often located in the heart of the city center (and downtown Chicago, Denver, DC, Atlanta, and the like are always centrally located).  They offer great onsite amenities like pool, gym, hot tub, complimentary breakfast, and free wifi in the rooms.  Plus, as others have mentioned, they are usually in excellent locations and their rooms are always clean and well kept.  As a matter of fact, I can't think of a single time when I've had a bad experience at a HGI.

            "<s> I'm in search of the top-notch mid-range hotel chain; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between affordability, convenience, and a consistently pleasant guest experience?I am a frequent business traveler and as such, I've stayed at numerous mid-range hotels throughout the country, but I always get the feeling that I'm just not getting the best value that I could be. In the past, I've tried to balance the value equation by staying at non-branded hotels. But, for the past few years, I've been staying at the same chain, whose name I won't mention. The chain has a pretty consistent product, and I've usually been satisfied with my room, but I haven't really gotten a whole lot of value for my money in the last couple of years.I know that my experience probably differs from other guests, since I travel fairly frequently for work, and that my tastes and needs probably tend towards the high end. But I'm interested to hear if anyone has any suggestions for a hotel brand whose product really delivers a pleasant experience. I've stayed at several Hyatts, Westins and Starwoods, and while they're pretty consistent, I'm not completely sold on them. So, if anyone has any suggestions, I'd really appreciate them!What's the hotel chain?I second the Hilton Garden Inn. I've always been really impressed with that brand. The location of the properties that I've been to seems like it was chosen specifically to be near a highway, which means that when you're in your room, you're far away from the noise of the road. The rooms are spacious, and I've always enjoyed my stays.I like the Holiday Inn Express.I know what you mean about chain hotels. I am a big Hilton fan. I've stayed at almost all their brands except a Doubletree which I didn't like. Their loyalty program is great too with the HHonors program. If I was to use a different chain though, I think I would go with Marriott. I've stayed at both Courtyard and Renaissance properties and I was impressed with the size of the rooms and the service.I can highly recommend the Holiday Inn Express brand. They're very consistent, and offer a lot of value for what you get.http://www.hiexpress.com/I'd stay with you at Hilton.I am a Hilton Diamond member and the Hilton chain offers consistency of product at every property around the world. In addition, the hotels tend to be located in convenient locations. When I have had trouble with reservations I have always been impressed with Hilton customer service representatives.One additional benefit with the Hilton chain is that they always have a welcome gift for Diamond members.As far as hotels that don't provide a consistent product, I would suggest that you stay away from all chain hotels and try to get a room in a non-chain hotel. I think this is one of the reasons you are not getting the value for your money, in that you are being exposed to the same product over and over at different hotels. You don't even know what you are missing at the non-chain hotels.I just finished a trip where I stayed at the Hilton in Houston, the Hyatt in Chicago, the Park Hyatt in Chicago, the Hyatt on Capitol Hill in DC and the Hilton in DC. The Park Hyatt in Chicago was wonderful. However, the Hilton in Houston was run down, the Hyatt in Chicago was dirty, the Park Hyatt in DC was a mess and the Hyatt in DC was noisy. The Hilton in DC was the best of the group, but it was not a good Hilton product.I also stay a lot at non-chain hotels. I think the key to the non-chain product is to ask to see the room before making the reservation. Often, a room in a non-chain hotel will look great on-line, but it does not look nearly as nice when you enter the room.I just had an experience at the Hilton in Houston where they were understaffed and had a terrible breakfast. Also, my hotel was located in an industrial section of Houston that I would not have selected for a business hotel. In other words, the service and the hotel are not consistent.The best solution is to get a hotel that has been selected based on the location and is non-chain. The challenge is getting the right hotel in the right location.I also think you should stay away from a hotel brand where you can choose between two beds, one queen and one king size. You may want to sleep on the king size, but I cannot ever choose the bed type. This is a non-standard feature for a hotel.My suggestion is to check out the Holiday Inn Express in Buford, Georgia, just outside of Atlanta. I was there two years ago for a conference, and the hotel was great. The rooms were nice and clean, and the staff was really friendly. It was also pretty conveniently located, and the price was very reasonable.I also recently stayed at a Hampton Inn in Atlanta, and that was pretty nice too. I wasn't impressed by the room size or the staff, but the location was convenient, and the price was good.The best solution is to get a hotel that has been selected based on the location and is non-chain.I would love to be able to do this, but it's just not possible for me. I travel frequently for business, and as such, I need to be able to rely on the consistency of the brand. If I'm in a hotel I don't like, I'll usually have to pay for an extra night to switch to a hotel that's closer to my destination. This makes it pretty difficult to pick a hotel based on its location, as I have to consider the price of an extra night's stay.I would love to be able to do this, but it's just not possible for me. I travel frequently for business, and as such, I need to be able to rely on the consistency of the brand. If I'm in a hotel I don't like, I'll usually have to pay for an extra night to switch to a hotel that's closer to my destination.Hilton was able to do this for me when I traveled to China for business. I called the Hilton hotel in Xian and told them that I was unhappy with the hotel where I was staying. I was able to negotiate a better rate for my additional night.If you are a member of the Hilton HHonors program, you will also have a lot of additional opportunities. You will get a higher priority for room selection, breakfast coupons, free room upgrades, and free stays.I'm a big fan of Hilton's because of the HHonors program. Whenever I travel for business, I always try to stay at a Hilton property, because it's so easy to earn points and get rewarded for my loyalty. And, as others have mentioned, the product is pretty consistent across the board. I really like the Homewood Suites and Home2 Suites as well. They're nice and new, and they offer more of a home away from home kind of experience.Hilton is my favorite hotel chain. I've stayed at them all over the world and they're consistently the best.I've stayed at the Embassy Suites quite a few times and always enjoyed my stay. I've also stayed at the Sheraton quite a few times and also enjoyed my stay.I just had an experience at the Hilton in Houston where they were understaffed and had a terrible breakfast.If you are in a Hilton, the Hilton staff usually includes two full time managers. One is in charge of rooms, the other is in charge of food and beverage. This makes for a very consistent product because both managers have full time jobs and have no incentive to treat you poorly.In contrast, many hotel managers in a non-chain hotel work part time, usually as an evening manager and a day manager. This creates an environment where both managers have incentive to treat you poorly, because they are not paid for the hours they are actually working.I've stayed at Holiday Inn Express hotels before, and I thought the rooms were pretty nice and the staff was friendly. But, as others have mentioned, it's really hard to get a hotel based on location.I've also heard good things about the Marriott brand. The only issue I've had with them is that they're usually pretty pricey.Hilton and Marriott are definitely the best ones. Both are consistent and offer good quality.I've stayed at many mid-range hotels and I've found that they're not very consistent. They're either great or terrible. You just have to hope that you're lucky enough to stay at a good one.You just have to hope that you're lucky enough to stay at a good one.I've heard some mixed reviews about Marriott, but I've stayed in their hotels and I've never had any issues. Their customer service is really good and their rooms are always clean. I've also stayed at Hilton and Holiday Inn Express and I've been happy with both.If I'm in a hotel I don't like, I'll usually have to pay for an extra night to switch to a hotel that's closer to my destination.When I travel for business, I always look for the best hotel that is close to my destination. If the hotel is far from where I am going, I will often pay for the additional nights.I'm a big fan of the Hilton brand. They have a lot of great properties around the world and their customer service is excellent.I've also stayed at many of their competitors and found that the rooms are usually smaller, the beds are not very comfortable, and the staff is not very helpful.If you are traveling for business, I would definitely recommend the Hilton brand.It really depends on the specific hotel chain and your individual experience.I have stayed in Hilton hotels in many different cities and have had a great experience every time. The rooms are usually very clean and the service is always friendly. I have also stayed in several other hotel chains and have had mixed experiences.I would recommend staying at the Hilton because of their consistency and excellent customer service.I think that you will find the same issues in any hotel chain. The key is to find the hotel chain that offers the best balance between affordability, convenience, and a consistently pleasant guest experience.I'm not sure if it's worth it, but I've always found that the Hilton hotels are pretty consistent in terms of quality, and I think that's part of the appeal.

            "<s> I'm in search of the top-notch mid-range hotel chain; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between affordability, convenience, and a consistently pleasant guest experience? I don't have any particular preference for a brand, I just don't want to overpay for the middle-tier of a chain that might otherwise be at the higher-end.The Marriott Courtyard brand seems like it's a good candidate for this list, but I'm open to recommendations.Sheraton, Holiday Inn, and Best Western are my other options. I'd prefer to avoid branded hotels, but if a certain one has a great loyalty program I'm happy to consider them.If it matters, I'm in North America but I'm flexible to any region.I'm not sure if this will help, but I've had the most success with Choice properties in this category. They are not top of mind for most people, but they have a fairly well established mid tier brand in their Ascend Hotel Collection.I don't know anything about the other branded properties you mention, but there are several independent properties that are worth mentioning. They may not have the same level of \"brand\" support, but they are pretty easy to find with online booking. I found these by searching for midrange properties in my area of interest (the US):http://www.inn-by-the-park.com/http://www.thewoodlandsinn.com/http://www.grandplazamotel.com/I don't know the specific properties, but I have been really pleased with my experiences in hotels with these names. They seem to have an established reputation for quality.I really like the Hilton Garden Inn chain. They're often near airports (a perk when flying business), and I've never stayed in one that didn't meet my expectations.Not that there aren't better hotels than Marriott's Courtyard brand in a particular region, but in general, it is a good brand for what you're looking for and a reasonable level of quality. The Courtyard Marriotts I've stayed in generally have had a nice breakfast, an in-room fridge, a decent business center, and reliable free wifi (although sometimes a bit slow).Hard to beat Holiday Inn Express.If you want a real hidden gem check out the DoubleTree Suites.If you have Marriott rewards points I'd consider the AC Marriotts. If not check out the Fairfield Inn.If your budget is around $150 a night the hotels you mentioned all have some great properties.If you're looking for something new check out Red Roof Inn. They have some great properties that compare to the Marriott brands in a similar price range.The Fairfield Inn by Marriott is also a good choice.I've found the Marriott Courtyard brand to be good for the middle-tier of a chain that might otherwise be at the higher-end. They tend to be more comfortable and affordable than a comparable Hilton or Hyatt and slightly less so than a comparable Sheraton or Westin. The free Internet is an added bonus.I'm in search of the top-notch mid-range hotel chain; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between affordability, convenience, and a consistently pleasant guest experience?Hilton Garden Inn and Residence Inn by Marriott are a little more expensive, but they are generally higher quality, have full kitchens and free breakfast and are very well located.I would say that the Hilton Garden Inn and the Courtyard are pretty much neck-and-neck, with the HGI a little ahead on the breakfast and the Courtyard a little ahead on the location. I tend to prefer the Courtyard but only because the Garden Inn is more expensive.My experience is that the Holiday Inn Express is usually the best bang for the buck among the hotels you listed.For what it's worth, this year has been the first time I've ever stayed in a \"Marriott Courtyard\" (in downtown Chicago), and it was quite comfortable. I can't compare it to a Holiday Inn or a Courtyard, but I was quite happy with the room, and there was plenty of space in the shower (which was much better than the showers in most NYC Marriott properties I've stayed in). The only thing I can say is that the room was a little cramped (which might be because of the layout of the city and surrounding buildings). I also didn't like the layout of the reception area (which was a narrow space between the street and the building lobby), but then again I was there during a conference and there was usually plenty of space for everyone. I'm just curious if they are the \"top-notch\" of a Marriott Courtyard (as it was the most expensive of the Courtyards I've ever stayed in).As others have mentioned, Holiday Inn Express has excellent properties in most markets. I would also add Fairfield Inn Marriott in the mix.I also like Marriott Residence Inn, for a little more space than you are looking for.In Chicago, Hyatt Place or Hyatt House are good options.I'm not sure where you live, but here in DC, there are some truly horrible (and not a little pricey) Marriott properties - The Crystal City Marriott is one such horror show.For something a little nicer, but still very good and affordable, I'd recommend the SpringHill Suites by Marriott. They are a bit more expensive than the Courtyard (and the Sheraton), but they are in great locations, have a nice breakfast, have full kitchens, and are very well maintained.The one I'm in now is pretty nice - Marriott's Residence Inn.Most of the hotels you mentioned are owned by Marriott and many are independently owned and operated. If you want a better experience in your Marriott you should stay in an independent owned property with the brand. Marriott is a terrible company to work for and their brand is so heavily diluted that there is no real difference between the different brands of Marriott owned properties. Staying in one that is independently owned makes all the difference. For example, when I travel to the DC area I tend to stay in the Crystal City area. There are several Marriott owned properties there, however, they all suck and they are all overpriced. There is one property, the Sheraton Crystal City, that is independently owned. It is fantastic and well run. I have stayed in it three times.There is no perfect hotel in any category. My favorite hotel for the money in the US is the Holiday Inn Express in the Boston area.I'd add the Hilton Garden Inn to the list of mid-range Marriott brands.I think it varies by location, but a lot of times when I'm looking for a hotel, Marriott is at the top of my list because they tend to have properties in convenient places, and their points program is flexible.A lot of hotels are owned by franchisees and the hotels may not be high quality.I also stay at Marriott hotels because they offer free breakfast.The one thing I don't like is the internet - it's never free, and they try to nickle and dime you for anything else.I've had good luck with Courtyards, so if you're loyal to Marriott, I'd start there.I like the Marriott Courtyard for the breakfast and the free internet. You pay extra if you want to bring your own breakfast or stay without wifi.My wife and I stay at Courtyard by Marriott most of the time. They are always clean and have a nice breakfast. There is a great loyalty program where you earn points to use for free stays.Courtyard by Marriott is excellent for what you're asking for.Ascend hotels are great - the hotel you posted in the Boston area is perfect.</s>",
            "<s> I'm in search of the top-notch mid-range hotel chain; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between affordability, convenience, and a consistently pleasant guest experience?Which hotel chain has the greatest percentage of top-notch hotels in the country?I would appreciate any insight, especially if your answers are based on your own personal experiences at these hotel chains.My answers are based on personal experiences.Which chain do you have in mind?I'm in search of a top-notch chain, but I don't have any specific chains in mind at this point.The Holiday Inn and Hilton are very consistent in their quality. Marriott and Best Western have a lot of inconsistent quality.I have also had a lot of inconsistent experiences with Hampton Inns and the Days Inns and Super 8.It's hard to know how far outside of an area the hotel is until you get there. I usually check the online map (Google Maps, MSN Mapquest, etc.) and make sure it is within the range I want to stay. If it's too far, I usually call and find out the approximate distance and make sure I'm okay with that distance before making the reservation.I've always found Hilton and Marriott to be among the most consistent, though I don't have a particular favorite.I used to stay at Days Inns on occasion (many years ago, and I don't recall if they have all changed their name, but I do know that they are all under a new corporate umbrella). However, I've had very mixed results with them. Some of them were fine. Others were not.In terms of consistency, I think Marriott wins hands down. I would only recommend Hampton Inn for someone who has stayed at them before and liked the quality and location. Other than that, I would avoid them like the plague. Hilton's are also pretty consistent, but they can vary in quality from country to country. The \"chain\" concept is so vague in so many other countries that you have to be careful.My top choices (and I've stayed at them all and used them on business and leisure trips all over the place):1) Courtyard by Marriott (formerly The Residence Inn, which was good)2) Hampton Inn (formerly Hilton's Homewood Suites, which was also very good)3) Hyatt PlaceI've stayed at Hyatt Place, Hampton Inn, and Holiday Inn Express. I was at the Hyatt Place a few days ago and was very impressed. It was not far from the airport (BWI) so I didn't stay there for the amenities or anything but it was clean, comfortable, and modern. It was a little bit more expensive than I would like but it wasn't ridiculously high.I've also stayed at Hampton Inn and Holiday Inn Express, both were also very nice and very comparable in price. They are both relatively new (built within the last 10 years) and the beds were extremely comfortable, clean, and everything you would want for a reasonable price.I'm with Gigi's comments about Courtyard. It was a really nice hotel and I would stay there again, but I wouldn't call it \"top notch.\" There were some things that were great, but I can't say it was the best. There is a very nice Hilton down the road from the Courtyard, so I didn't think they could compete with that and I think they made a valiant effort, but didn't quite make it.I've stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn and really enjoyed it. It's a little more expensive than some of the other places, but I thought it was worth it.I have found that the best way to find out about a hotel is to read the reviews on travel sites like Trip Advisor and Orbitz. Also, ask around for recommendations.We've stayed at several Courtyard by Marriott's (including the one at the airport near BWI) and we've been very happy with them. It's not an exorbitant amount more than other places and I think we'd stay there again.We've stayed at a Hampton Inn as well, and although the hotel was fine, the customer service and receptionist were terrible.There are a lot of options to consider with your questions. What do you mean by \"balance between affordability, convenience, and a consistently pleasant guest experience\"?I don't think I can give you just one answer, but I can tell you what we have found to be a great balance.We've stayed in Days Inn/Howard Johnson in a few different areas and have been very happy with them. Our last few stays have been at a Days Inn in New York City and it was great! We were only a few blocks away from our meeting, which was easy to walk to. We got a great deal online and our room was great. We even went up to the 12th floor to use the pool which had a fantastic view.I don't know if you'll be able to find any Days Inn's near where you're looking, but it was really great!There is a very nice Days Inn in Tampa. We have stayed at several Days Inn's and they have always been fine for us. We have never had a bad experience with them and I would definitely recommend them.It's not always easy to tell what kind of experience you're going to get at a particular hotel, but with a Days Inn you can always feel confident that you'll be treated well.If you want to try out a different chain, I'd recommend the La Quinta Inn. They're in a lot of places and they are very nice. The rooms are very spacious, clean, and comfortable. The beds are great and the hotel is always nice and quiet.The only negative thing I have to say about La Quinta is that they have a strict cancellation policy. If you cancel your reservation after a certain point, they charge you the full price of the room. I've had to do that once or twice, but it's never been a big deal.Another hotel that's been recommended to me is the Hilton Garden Inn. They're pretty good too, and they have some locations that are really nice.I know a lot of people love the Hampton Inn, but I've never been that impressed with them.Overall, the best balance is probably going to be somewhere in between the La Quinta Inn and the Hilton Garden Inn. Those are both really nice hotels that are affordable and convenient.This is a very difficult question to answer. There are so many different types of hotels out there that it's hard to know what the right balance is. It really depends on what you are looking for.My suggestion is that you do a little research and make a list of all the different kinds of hotels that you are interested in. Then you can go online and look up the reviews and compare prices.I think it's important to consider price, amenities, location, and size.I would recommend looking into Best Western, Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn, and Days Inn.I'm not a hotel reviewer but I've been to a lot of different ones and I'd say that I've had some of my best experiences at Hampton Inn. I would also say that Hilton Garden Inn and Courtyard by Marriott have been great for me too.As far as the best balance between affordability, convenience, and a consistently pleasant guest experience, I would recommend looking into Hilton, Holiday Inn, and Hyatt.I've never stayed at a Days Inn, but I can tell you that I've been very pleased with Hampton Inn.I'm looking for the best balance of affordability, convenience, and consistency.The best hotel chain in my opinion is the Marriott. It's affordable, convenient, and always has a great service.The Hyatt is pretty good as well. It's a bit pricier than Marriott, but still very good.If you want to stay in a hotel with a more unique experience, I would recommend the Hampton Inn. They have a very relaxing environment and great customer service.I think that the Hilton is the best hotel chain in the country. They have a really good quality/price ratio and they always have the best amenities.I stay in different hotels all over the world, and I always try to find the best one for my needs. There are a lot of different options out there, but I always go with Hilton.The best balance between affordability, convenience, and consistently pleasant guest experience is Hilton. I have stayed in Hilton hotels all over the world and they have always been clean, comfortable, and have provided me with a great service. I would definitely recommend staying at a Hilton hotel.I have been to some really nice hotels, but the ones that stand out the most in my mind are:- Marriott Hotels & Resorts- Hilton Hotels & ResortsI think that the Hilton and Marriott are the best chains in the country.

            "<s> I'm in search of the top-notch mid-range hotel chain; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between affordability, convenience, and a consistently pleasant guest experience?Thanks for your thoughts and suggestions, all!Came here to post the same question. We are staying at the new Hyatt in downtown DC and it's very nice. But a little pricier than some of the other recommendations.@Mackintridge: Do you mean the Hyatt Place in D.C.? I can't remember if that's in the convention center, or further downtown.I think my answer will be: the chain hotel that has the lowest standard room price in each location, which will change according to the time of year.If you really need to be midrange, the Holiday Inn is very nice, and there is one in every major city.But it's really just not the same experience as staying at a good boutique or at a luxury hotel.I have had very good luck with the Embassy Suites chain, and I would also put the Hyatt Place on the list. They are both nice and have consistency.You will likely spend 1-2x the price, but the Marriott Residence Inns are really nice.I would also put the Renaissance chain in that list. They have 3-4 floors, and are really nice.Hyatt Place downtown DC is a good choice.Hard to disagree with the Holiday Inn Express. There was just a new one open at the end of a main street in Boston with a Starbucks and a CVS around the corner - couldn't get better than that.I would add the Hilton Garden Inn to the list of chains as well. They are nice.I just spent a week at the new Hyatt in Washington DC and would not stay anywhere else in the area. It's right on the Metro, is 2 blocks from the National Gallery and has really good food. They have a nice pool as well.Also stay away from the downtown DC Hilton. It's a dump and you can't tell which is the right door to enter from the street!I would second the Hilton Garden Inns.I also have good experiences with Embassy Suites.I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites in Cambridge, MD about 18 months ago and it was very nice. I have to admit that I am not an expert on hotel chains but this one is very much on my radar if I ever find myself near Cambridge again.Would recommend the Westin in SF and W Chicago Downtown. I also liked The Westin in Chicago's River North neighborhood, but it's a bit far away from the shopping area and the lake. I also stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn in San Francisco and that one was okay. If you want to go high-end I'd probably recommend the W or the Intercontinental.I like the Marriott ExecuStay locations - I've been to a few different ones and they're always great.I would suggest the Marriott Courtyard line. I have stayed in a few and they were all good. I have also stayed in an Embassy Suites and it was also nice.I stay at the Courtyards a lot and am very satisfied. They have an all night restaurant in the lobby that is nice.Would agree with @caveman that the Courtyards are good. I've stayed at the Chicago one. It was nice and the rate was pretty reasonable. Also stay away from the downtown Hilton in DC. It is in the worst part of the city. Stay at the Embassy Suites near the Verizon center.There are 2 options in downtown SF that I really liked, the Hyatt Regency and the Marriott Marquis. The Marriott Marquis was a good deal last week.I've always been pleased with Holiday Inns as well.If you're in DC, I'd recommend the new Hyatt in downtown DC. I've stayed there twice and it's a great location.I really like the Holiday Inns. They seem to be a little lower priced than some of the others.Would recommend Courtyards, Marriotts and Embassy Suites.I second the Embassy Suites! The one in Chicago is really nice, and I like that you have your own bedroom and living room with a kitchenette.I would recommend the Marriott Courtyards as well.My favorite has always been the Embassy Suites. You always get free breakfast and there is a big hot tub.</s>",
            "<s> I'm in search of the top-notch mid-range hotel chain; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between affordability, convenience, and a consistently pleasant guest experience?For us, the W hotel is the answer to that question.I was first introduced to this hotel chain several years ago by a co-worker who's been going to W hotels for a while. For me, it's become one of those chains where you expect a certain level of excellence in everything from the location and the rooms, to the food and the service.The first time I stayed at a W, I was a bit skeptical. I wasn't sure if the hotel would be too much of an eye sore, or too ostentatious, for my taste. I went with the former and I was blown away. For me, the W chain is the best combination of aesthetic, practicality and convenience for me.When I travel for business, I usually get to choose the hotel I'll be staying in. And, I usually try to stay at a hotel that has the best balance of the three attributes I mentioned earlier: affordability, convenience and a consistently pleasant guest experience.My top choices are Hyatt, Holiday Inn and Best Western. And, each of them has their strengths and weaknesses. In general, though, I think that they all deliver on the three elements of my formula.Hyatt is one of the first chains that came to my mind when I first started planning for my trip. I've heard great things about their properties. And, the reviews are very positive. But, I've been told that their properties are often a little out of the way and don't have a lot of amenities.Holiday Inn is another chain that has come to mind when I've been planning my trips. It seems to be the more affordable option of the two. The reviews are generally positive as well. But, the chain is known for being a little more out of the way.I'm going to take a step back for a moment and look at how much it would cost me to stay at a top-notch mid-range hotel chain. I have a good idea of the average cost of these properties, but I wanted to take a look at what they'd look like if I could afford to stay at them for a week or two.I'm going to look at some of the most expensive cities in the country and see what the typical cost would be to stay at one of these hotels for a week.1. If I had $500 to spend each day, I could easily afford to stay in New York City.2. If I could only afford to stay in one of the top 10 hotels in the country, I would probably spend the majority of the time in San Francisco.3. If I could only afford to stay in one of the top 10 hotels in the United States, I would probably spend the majority of my time in Chicago.4. If I could only afford to stay in one of the top 10 hotels in Canada, I would probably spend the majority of my time in Toronto.I could probably come up with a few more places, but I think that this is a pretty good starting point. Now, let's take a look at what the typical cost would be to stay at one of these hotels for a week.1. If I had $1000 to spend each day, I could easily afford to stay in New York City.3. If I could only afford to stay in one of the top 10 hotels in Canada, I would probably spend the majority of my time in Toronto.4. If I could only afford to stay in one of the top 10 hotels in the United States, I would probably spend the majority of my time in Chicago.5. If I could only afford to stay in one of the top 10 hotels in the United Kingdom, I would probably spend the majority of my time in London.6. If I could only afford to stay in one of the top 10 hotels in Australia, I would probably spend the majority of my time in Melbourne.7. If I could only afford to stay in one of the top 10 hotels in South Africa, I would probably spend the majority of my time in Johannesburg.8. If I could only afford to stay in one of the top 10 hotels in India, I would probably spend the majority of my time in Mumbai.9. If I could only afford to stay in one of the top 10 hotels in China, I would probably spend the majority of my time in Beijing.10. If I could only afford to stay in one of the top 10 hotels in the world, I would probably spend the majority of my time in Dubai.I'm sure that there are many more places that would be better than this, but I think that this is a pretty good starting point.If you could only afford to stay at a top-notch mid-range hotel chain for a week, which one would you spend your time at?I'd probably stay in one of the best hotels in Dubai. Dubai is one of my favorite cities in the world and I think that there is nothing that can be compared to the experience of staying in a luxury hotel in this city.I think that it is always great to have a hotel that offers a high-quality service and a great location. I think that staying at one of the top-notch mid-range hotel chains can offer you a very good experience. I think that the best mid-range hotel chain for me would be The Four Seasons. The Four Seasons is a hotel chain that offers a high quality service and a great location.I think that the top-notch mid-range hotel chains are a great choice for anyone who wants to have a good experience while traveling. I think that staying at a hotel chain that offers a high-quality service and a great location can offer you a very good experience.The W chain is the answer to that question.

The hotel is in the center of the city, so it's easy to get to.For the hotel to be considered top-notch, it must have a very good reputation.I think that there are several ways to measure the quality of a hotel.There are many different factors that determine the quality of a hotel. These factors include the level of service, the location, the atmosphere, the rooms, the amenities, the food, the staff, the management, the facilities, the hotel brand, and the facilities and amenities.The level of service is the most important factor.

            "<s> I'm in search of the top-notch mid-range hotel chain; any recommendations for the one that offers the best balance between affordability, convenience, and a consistently pleasant guest experience?As I have written previously, hotels are a necessary evil. They are a means to a necessary end, to be sure, but in many ways are more than a bit ridiculous. They're also extremely fun!In the past, I have stayed at places ranging from very expensive to free (but definitely not inexpensive), from chains like Hilton to independents like the lovely Hotel Monaco and the swank Hotel 116.Here are three of my main considerations, and how I rate each brand.As much as I like free or low-cost options, they often don't offer much in the way of consistency. Sometimes, it seems that all the amenities you might want to use might be missing from the room you're staying in, or the desk clerk may not be in a good mood. The mid-range brands offer more consistency. I know what the amenities will be, the service will be good, and the overall experience will be solid and reliable. That's a big plus for me.Another major consideration for me is the actual location of the hotel. Sometimes the location may seem great at first, but turns out to be a bit inconvenient or just doesn't work for my needs. For example, the Hotel 116 was great, but it was too far from my final destination. If the hotel was just a few blocks away, that would have been a real plus.The third factor is cost. My most recent bout of staying in hotels has me spending about $100 per night, with a couple of exceptions. I don't mind paying $200 for a night or two on special occasions, but in general, I'd prefer to spend $100 or less, including tax and fees.With those criteria in mind, I want to hear from you. Which brands do you like? What are your favorite locations and features?</s>",
