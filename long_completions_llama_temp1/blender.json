            "<s> I'm curious to know your preference for the blender that offers the best combination of blending performance, durable construction, and overall convenience in preparing a variety of ingredients.I'm using a Breville Boss Smoothie Blender and I'm very happy with it. But, I'm always interested to know what others think and what others are using.I've read mixed reviews on the Vitamix 5200 vs the Omega 6000. But, I'm curious to hear what others think about these and other blenders.I'm currently using a Hamilton Beach blender with the standard plastic blender blades, a blend of ingredients including various fruits, nuts, and water, and using a moderate amount of force while pushing down with my finger on the pulse button for about 30 seconds or so. I've never noticed any problems with it and it's been working fine.However, I have heard that blenders made of stainless steel are preferable for blending, in addition to a motor that's capable of more than 2 horsepower (which is what my blender has). But, I don't know if blenders made of stainless steel are more expensive than those made of plastic.So, does anyone have a suggestion or recommendation?In my opinion the 5200 is the way to go...they are about $100 cheaper than the 6000. I have a 5200 and am very satisfied with the results I get.The 6000's I have seen seem to be better built and have higher torque, but I have read that it is not enough to overcome the fact that it has a 1.5 hp motor, and the blades can not be changed out. This makes it more difficult to repair if broken. I have read that one owner had to replace it 5 times!I personally don't care about the 1.5 HP because I don't really know how it is better than the 2 HP.If it were me, I would buy the 5200.I have a Vitamix 5300 that I have owned for three years. I have had nothing but good experiences with it. There is an upgrade that I bought a year ago that allows it to pulverize ice. I have used it for that as well as other drinks and the result is amazing.I have been blending on a daily basis for over 30 years.The first blender I had was a Champion and I used that for 5 years.I have owned a Cuisinart (it lasted 2 years and it was a great machine but I lost it in a flood)I have owned a Blendtec, Vitamix, Waring Pro and Breville.My favorite and one that I now own is the Waring Pro.I like it because the lid is not as heavy as the other blenders. I am 6'3\" and weigh about 280 lbs and the lid on the Waring Pro is easy for me to lift.The Vitamix is very heavy. The Waring Pro costs a little less. The Waring Pro will not hold up as long as the Vitamix but it is worth every cent I paid for it.I also love the fact that I can put ice cubes in the Waring Pro. I am able to get a frozen margarita made with freshly made ice cubes (that were made in a Waring ice crusher and I can have a frozen margarita in under 5 minutes.The Waring Pro also comes with a blending blade that is 3\" tall and is much bigger and longer than the Vitamix blade.I can fit a full cup of protein powder in the Waring Pro and then mix it up with ice cubes and water.If I have some fruits in the fridge that I want to blend, I add them and blend them.I have never had any problems with the Waring Pro. I love my Waring Pro.I have never been disappointed with a Waring product. I will tell you that the quality of their products has gone downhill in recent years.I do not feel that the 5300 is as good as the 6300. The 6300 blender is about twice as heavy as the 5300.I think the 5300 would be a better choice.I have had my 6300 for 1 year and I will tell you it is still as good as the day I got it. I am glad that I got the 6300 because it is much heavier and sturdier than the 5300.The 6300 comes with a stainless steel blender blade and I like this better than the Waring blade. The 6300 is also a little bit bigger and taller than the 5300.You can get a little more ice crushed with the 6300 than with the 5300.You should know that the Vitamix is not the best blender on the market. I do not think that the Vitamix is a very durable blender. It is not a good buy at $500. I would not spend that kind of money on a blender.I would recommend that you get the Waring Pro.The Waring Pro is a great blender and I would recommend that you buy one.The Waring Pro is the best blender for you if you are on a budget.I am not sure what you mean by \"better built\". What do you mean?Vitamix is an American company and Waring is an American company.Vitamix is one of the most popular blenders in the world. I believe the Vitamix is the best blender.I hope that you will get the Vitamix and enjoy your new blender.I don't think there is a better blender on the market today.I have never had any issues with the Waring Pro.The Vitamix 6300 is a great blender and it is more expensive than the Waring Pro.It is the best blender that I have ever owned and I have owned a lot of them.The Vitamix 6300 is a great blender and I would recommend it to anyone.The Waring Pro is a great blender and it is a lot cheaper than the Vitamix.The Waring Pro will not hold up as long as the Vitamix but it is worth every cent I paid for it.I like the fact that I can put ice cubes in the Waring Pro.

Very helpful. I do have a few questions though.I have a blender but I think I want a VitaMix as well. I want to blend some nut butter, protein powder, and ice cubes and make a smoothie. Does this sound like a good reason for a Vitamix?Is it okay to put ice cubes in a Vitamix? Does it have to be frozen?Does it make sense to buy a stainless steel blender? If so, which one do you think would be the best?If you're blending protein powder and ice cubes, the Waring is going to be the better blender for you. The Vitamix has a plastic lid and plastic parts which can easily crack. The Waring is much more sturdy and built to last for a long time.The Waring has a 3\" blending blade, while the Vitamix has a 2\" blending blade. This makes a huge difference when blending things like ice. The 2\" blades are a lot easier to clog up with things like frozen margaritas and protein powder with ice.The Waring Pro is not the best blender out there. The Waring Pro is the best blender for you if you are on a budget.If you are going to use your blender a lot, I would recommend that you buy a Vitamix.I have never had any problems with the Waring Pro.

            "<s> I'm curious to know your preference for the blender that offers the best combination of blending performance, durable construction, and overall convenience in preparing a variety of ingredients. It's difficult to get a complete overview of blenders and their unique qualities in the context of their overall performance. A few factors that contribute to their usefulness are the motor, the pitcher, and the blades.Another element that's critical in determining a blender's quality is the pitcher. A high-quality pitcher should be made of glass or stainless steel. Some of the higher-end models come with pitchers made of borosilicate glass. There are many more models, both high-end and more affordable ones that come with a stainless steel pitcher. These are more durable, and they heat evenly, so they're great for making warm smoothies and soups.A strong motor is the heart of a quality blender. Blenders with motors that can spin up to 2 horsepower are capable of handling any blending job. It is easy to grind tough ingredients and hard fruits. However, don't be fooled into thinking that all motors are created equal. Some blenders come with motors that are more powerful than others, and some are equipped with motors that have different levels of strength.A durable pitcher is essential for a blender. If you're going to use it frequently, a pitcher made of plastic or stainless steel is the best choice. This will ensure that you'll be able to use it for a long time.Another feature that you should look for is a blender's blades. The best blenders have blades made of metal or stainless steel. These blades are able to pulverize tough ingredients and make a silky-smooth mixture. However, blenders that don't have stainless steel or metal blades will not be able to cut through tough ingredients as effectively.Several blenders have several cups. This is an excellent feature for making multiple servings. However, you can also get blenders with a single cup. These are ideal for small families.Choosing a blender is a big decision. There are a lot of options out there. But if you choose one that meets your specific needs, you'll be happy you did.Choosing a blender with a large pitcher is a good idea. These will allow you to make large batches of smoothies and other food. If you don't have a large blender, you'll have to make smaller batches and add more liquid.If you're a beginner, a blender with an easy-to-use interface is a great option. Most of the blenders on the market have a one-touch pulse control. You can turn on the blender and then press the button to start the blending process.If you have a large kitchen and lots of space, a 5-cup blender is a great choice. These models are ideal for making smoothies, soups, sauces, and other food.When shopping for a blender, you should take into consideration the number of speeds. The number of speeds that the blender has will determine how powerful the motor is. A blender with a single speed is good enough for making smoothies and food, but if you're preparing thick and chunky ingredients, you'll need a model with a higher speed.The best blenders have variable speeds. These models can run from 1.5 horsepower to 2.2 horsepower. A blender with this level of power can run for up to ten minutes. These blenders are great for blending thick and chunky ingredients, and they can also be used to make smoothies.If you want a blender that is easy to clean, a pitcher that is dishwasher-safe is a great choice. You can also buy a blender that has a built-in tamper. This tamper is usually made of stainless steel and is a great option for blending thick ingredients.If you are on a tight budget, a blender with a single-serve option is a good choice. This is a blender that has a smaller pitcher and is ideal for single-serve recipes. You can also get a blender that has a multi-speed option.Choosing a blender is a big decision. There are many factors to consider, including the type of food you'll be making and the number of speeds that you'll need. You should also consider the motor's horsepower and the type of blades that it comes with. A blender with a strong motor and a high-quality pitcher is an investment in your health.The best blenders have a powerful motor and a sturdy pitcher. They also come with blades that are designed for pulverizing tough ingredients. You'll need a blender that can grind hard fruits and vegetables and make a thick mixture.</s>",

            "<s> I'm curious to know your preference for the blender that offers the best combination of blending performance, durable construction, and overall convenience in preparing a variety of ingredients.I'm asking about blenders because in my experience, when I try to make a smoothie out of a mix of ingredients, some of the ingredients don't end up blended as well as I'd like. I usually just add more ingredients to the blender so that it can't hold more, but that's not a very good solution because some of the ingredients become less blended as I add more.My current blender is a very inexpensive 500 watt blender that I bought for around $100 on sale. It does a good job at blending ingredients, but is a little noisy. I like the simplicity of this blender. It has a plastic jug with an opening in the lid for filling ingredients, a big black switch on top, and two large blades inside. The blender is made by a reputable manufacturer (Sony), but I suspect that its durability may be limited because it's made of plastic. I bought it from Walmart. I don't like blenders that I have to wash because it's a hassle.Here's a picture of this blender.I currently use this blender for blending smoothies.My wife prefers smoothies that are less blended than the one I've been making.What's the best blender that I can buy for the best combination of blending performance, durable construction, and overall convenience in preparing a variety of ingredients?Please do not provide specific brand names in your answers.

For instance, I have a Blendtec blender (also have a NutriBullet) and love them both for different reasons. I have also owned a Vita-Mix and loved it too. But what I want is a cheap, effective, simple, easy-to-use blender. I'm not looking for an industrial strength blender. I'm looking for something to blend smoothies and make ice cream, not a blender I use to blend ice. So, I think I can speak to the answer of your question, but it will only be based on my experience with the two aforementioned blenders.The NutriBullet is pretty cheap, but it can't really handle anything too hard. The Vita-Mix is definitely not a cheap blender, but it can handle practically anything. If you're looking for something that will stand up to a lot of use and make things really, really smooth, then go for the Vita-Mix. I'm not sure about the Sony blender you mention, but if it's a plastic one, it's probably not going to stand up to very much.posted by alwyn at 4:50 PM on October 3, 2012 [1 favorite]I've owned both the Blendtec and the Vitamix, and I like the Vitamix better because I don't have to keep cleaning the jagged parts. I've had a Vitamix for almost 20 years and it's still going strong.I love smoothies, and I own two Vitamixes and a Blendtec (the Blendtec is more of a \"gadget\" than a practical kitchen tool, IMHO). I can confirm that Vitamix blenders can blend virtually anything, are very durable, and are super easy to clean.I do think there is a difference between what the blenders are intended to do, however. The Blendtec is a blender. The Vitamix is a blender, but it's also a food processor. It has a much larger jar than the Blendtec and can easily blend foods like hummus and salsa. (The Blendtec is also marketed as a blender/food processor.)The Vitamix is also considerably more expensive than the Blendtec. I think it's worth it for the quality of the machine and the features (e.g., the lid that turns into a dry blender, etc.).posted by peanut_mcgillicuty at 4:55 PM on October 3, 2012 [3 favorites]I think if you want something you can buy at Walmart, the best option is a Nutribullet. I love mine, and I've made some serious smoothies in it. It's pretty much just a food processor with blades that you throw your food in, and it works really well. I've been using it for two years now and it still works great.posted by wemayfreeze at 4:56 PM on October 3, 2012 [3 favorites]I've had a Breville blender for 12 years and it still works fine. The jars are made of glass. If you put it into the freezer, it will stay clean for months.posted by xenu at 5:04 PM on October 3, 2012I've been using a Blendtec for 18 months and LOVE it. I can't say it's the best for blending, since that depends on your ingredients and what you want to do with them, but I've made salsa and hummus in it.I've also made green smoothies (spinach, almond milk, kale, spinach) in it.Also, a Vita-Mix is very difficult to clean, but I've heard that the new ones are more user-friendly.posted by SweetTeaAndABiscuit at 5:06 PM on October 3, 2012If you are a person who prefers smoothies that are less blended, you should be sure to get a blender that has a very good, very powerful motor.You can check the power on the blender by reading the fine print. There is a chart on the back of a Blendtec (link to chart) that tells you how powerful their blender is. I don't think the chart will be helpful for other brands.This chart is a good reference for blender power.Vitamix and Waring are other brands that are good quality and powerful.posted by The Winsome Parker Lewis at 5:06 PM on October 3, 2012 [4 favorites]I have a Vitamix. The biggest thing for me is that it makes super-smooth things, like hummus, and also, it can whip up stuff that would normally require an electric mixer. It has a powerful motor and will handle just about anything. The biggest con is that it's very expensive (although you can sometimes get a discount on Amazon).posted by peachfuzz at 5:08 PM on October 3, 2012The NutriBullet is probably the easiest blender to clean, as there's not much food on the inside that gets stuck. It's also quite affordable and compact. However, it has to be plugged in (and does make a bit of noise while blending). It's good for smoothies, not so much for more chunky items.The VitaMix or Blendtec can blend pretty much anything, including ice. I have no experience with the Vitamix, but the Blendtec is a little on the noisy side, but it's not uncomfortable to use. The jars on these are plastic and can crack if dropped. Also, they're kind of expensive.posted by lunasol at 5:21 PM on October 3, 2012 [1 favorite]Oh, forgot the last part of the question. The Vitamix and NutriBullet are both dishwasher safe.I've owned a Nutribullet for about 2 months and really like it. I can make all the smoothies I've wanted without any problem and it's dishwasher safe, which is huge. I've used it with fruits and veggies, and even some ground beef, but for the most part, it is very easy to clean and a little cheaper than most blenders, especially for someone who might use it every day for a few months and then not very often after that. I think it's a great value.posted by tuesdayschild at 5:31 PM on October 3, 2012I have owned an Oster FPSTSBW25 Food Processor with 48-Ounce Bowl since the 1980s. (I just googled and found that it is made by Black & Decker and that the brand was changed to Black & Decker in 1995).It's durable, easy to clean and simple to use. It does a great job of blending/processing.I've never used a Blendtec, but have looked at them. The Black & Decker seems very much like a larger version of the NutriBullet.posted by mareli at 5:36 PM on October 3, 2012I've had a Blendtec for a year and really like it. I find it easy to clean and it does a good job with all sorts of foods - although a big plastic jug can be kind of unwieldy. It's about half the price of a Vitamix.posted by dizziest at 5:42 PM on October 3, 2012My boyfriend and I have one of those black and decker food processors with the jug. It works very well and doesn't cost much. It's not super powerful so if you like blending smoothies that are really creamy, you'll have to work it a bit.posted by bunderful at 6:06 PM on October 3, 2012You may want to consider getting an immersion blender. It has a very long cord, so you can use it pretty much anywhere.posted by d.z. wang at 6:23 PM on October 3, 2012I have an immersion blender, and it doesn't even come close to blending things as well as my NutriBullet (the only smoothie I ever make is in my NutriBullet, so this could be a case of me loving the one I have.) I also have a KitchenAid food processor, but it takes up a ton of room on the counter and is a big hassle to clean. I wish there was a magic blender that would do everything I want and would also not take up counter space.posted by Linda_Holmes at 6:33 PM on October 3, 2012I use my NutriBullet daily (it's in the sink all the time and dishwasher safe), and I'm happy with it. The jars are small, though, so that's a consideration. I'm also glad that it's dishwasher-safe; otherwise, it'd be a huge pain to clean. The NutriBullet is very, very cheap and very easy to clean.The downside, I guess, is that if you're going to do blending that's actually blending, like making a cream sauce, this isn't really the thing. If you want something that's more a food processor and less a blender, then this is probably the better choice.I use a Breville blender at work every day, and it's fantastic. It's an immersion blender, so you don't have to plug it in, but it does need a bit of room to do its job. I used to use the Nutribullet at home, and it was really good at doing things like smoothies and salsas, but not so great at doing things that require an actual blender. It also didn't do a very good job of cleaning itself. The Breville is very easy to clean, and I don't mind that it's a bit larger because of the versatility.posted by Squee at 7:05 PM on October 3, 2012I got a Breville Boss as a gift from my husband a few months ago and it is really really nice. I have never owned a blender before and I love that it has blades on the top and the bottom, so there is a lot more blending that can happen! It is also pretty easy to clean and dishwasher safe. I haven't found any limitations to the ingredients I can use, and I like that it's smaller and takes up less space than my food processor. I bought a large jar of green smoothie powder that I put in all my smoothies. I find that the jars of powders are more convenient and affordable than getting the individual ingredients to make my own.posted by hannahdee at 7:15 PM on October 3, 2012I have owned a Breville blender for 12 years and it still works fine. The jars are made of glass. If you put it into the freezer, it will stay clean for months. It's small enough for small ingredients (like a few berries) but can take anything you throw in it.I love my blender! I think the biggest problem is that blenders just take up so much counter space. You can only have one sitting out or it looks like your kitchen is messy.posted by peachfuzz at 7:28 PM on October 3, 2012 [2 favorites]My blender has a motor that I believe is around 500W. This is one of the cheaper blenders from Breville, so that may not seem powerful, but it is powerful enough to make smoothies.The jar is plastic, which may or may not be a deal-breaker for you, but I didn't have a lot of trouble with it, and it's dishwasher safe.My Blendtec blender came with a jar and two sets of blades. The plastic jar has a silicone seal on the lid, and you put a metal blade into it. This is the \"basic\" blender for smoothies, but it's pretty amazing at breaking down things like cauliflower into a paste. (This is the most important feature for me, so if you want a blender to be good at breaking things down, then I'd recommend Blendtec.)The other jar is a jar, without the silicone seal, and you put two different kinds of blades in. The regular jar can be used with metal or plastic blades, but I think you'll only be able to use the metal blade on the jar with the silicone seal.posted by thegears at 7:38 PM on October 3, 2012I love my Blendtec! I just use it for blending smoothies, but it's powerful enough that it also handles things like blending nuts and seeds to use in baking.I have a Vitamix and a Nutribullet. I like them both, but I love my Nutribullet for ease of cleaning and the power (it's basically a blender and food processor in one).posted by ch1x0r at 7:45 PM on October 3, 2012I have had a Blendtec blender for about 4 years and I LOVE it. It is very powerful, so it blends quickly and easily, and I can blend a large variety of ingredients without difficulty. The blender comes with a jar and two sets of blades: a regular jar with two blades for basic blending, and a smaller jar with two blades for finer blending. I used the regular blending jar for the first year, and then switched to the smaller jar and blades for more control. This blender is expensive, but I have had zero problems with it. It is made of durable plastic, and does not heat up while blending (as far as I can tell). The blender comes with a 6 year warranty, and I think it is worth every cent.I have a Breville Blender and I love it. It's a little big to store on the counter, but I just leave it on top of the fridge. It's very easy to clean and I've never had any problems with it. The blades can get a little scratched up, but that's to be expected with blenders.posted by cassiencave at",

robust motor?Food processors are designed for use with soft foods like vegetables, fruits, meat, etc., while blenders are designed to process harder foods like grains, nuts, and herbs.Though some blenders may be used for light food processing such as chopping, it is not advised as the blades are not strong enough to break through the hardened food particles.Therefore, you must know the difference between the two to be able to choose one of them for yourself.The food processor is a versatile kitchen appliance that can perform various functions like chopping, slicing, grating, etc.It is easy to use and has an ergonomic design that allows users to handle it easily without putting much pressure on their hands or arms.The blender, on the other hand, is used mainly for blending ingredients like fruits, vegetables, and milk into smoothies or drinks.The blender has more powerful motors than a food processor and produces finer blends than any other kitchen tool.It also comes with several attachments that make it easier to clean up after use or reuse ingredients that would otherwise go to waste.The only difference between the two is that the food processor has a wider range of blades to choose from and has a larger capacity.Therefore, we will recommend the food processor to you if you need a versatile kitchen appliance.This blender has a high-speed motor with a 2.5-peak HP induction motor for quick and smooth processing.The food processor has a 3-cup capacity and 12-cup capacity in two sizes respectively.This blender comes with 2 S-blade blending pitches, an S-blade, and a blending pitch.The S-blade blending pitch is designed to reduce chop times and save time.This blender also has a 4-way pitcher lid that allows you to easily add ingredients to the blender.There are also 3 food-grade stainless-steel blades that are specially designed to ensure that you can chop and blend your food in the shortest possible time.The food processor also comes with an integrated feeding tube that allows you to add ingredients without disturbing the contents in the blender.This blender is dishwasher safe and comes with a limited one-year warranty.The blender has a powerful 2.1-peak HP induction motor for smooth and quick processing.The blender has a 2-liter jar and 1-liter jar, so you can make a large quantity of food in one batch or prepare smaller quantities of food in smaller batches.The blender also comes with 5 pre-programmed settings that let you control the speed of the blender based on your preferences.The blender has an integrated

needs perfectly.The blenders listed above are all great choices and will fit the needs of most people.The key to choosing the right blender is to consider the size of your kitchen and the amount of time you spend in it.If you have a large kitchen, you will need a blender with more powerful motors and larger capacity blades.However, if you have a small kitchen, you will need a blender with less powerful motors and smaller capacity blades.Once you have chosen the right blender, it is important to keep it clean so that it will last for years to come.Be sure to clean your blender after every use so that it does not become clogged with food debris.And finally, do not forget to clean your blender on a regular basis so that it stays in good condition and lasts for years to come.There is a lot to be said for the convenience of using a blender in the kitchen.If you are in the market for a new blender, here are some things you should look for when making your decision.There are a variety of different blenders on the market, and each one has its own features.When choosing a blender, you should look for one that is easy to clean and has a large capacity.You should also consider the power source of the blender.If you are looking for a blender that can power through tough food, look for one with a high-quality motor.The price of the blender is another important factor to consider.Make sure you choose a blender that fits your budget.The last thing you want to do is spend money on a blender that you cannot afford to use on a regular basis.It is important to note that not all blenders are created equal.Some blenders are better suited for specific tasks than others.For example, some blenders are better suited for making smoothies than they are for chopping vegetables.If you are looking for a blender that can do both, be sure to look for one that has multiple settings and is easy to clean.There are many reasons to choose a blender over other kitchen appliances.For one, blenders can blend food items that are tough to mix or crush.This means that you can use them to make salads, sandwiches, and other foods that are difficult to blend using other kitchen appliances.Blenders are also easy to clean and store.They come in a variety of sizes, so you can find one that fits your needs.Finally, blenders are less likely to break down or malfunction
