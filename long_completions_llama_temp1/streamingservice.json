            "<s> I'm in search of a reliable streaming service, and I'm wondering if you have a recommendation for one that offers a diverse range of movies and TV shows, including both classic and current content.As you've suggested, I've been researching the various streaming services available and have narrowed my options down to three platforms: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu. I'll compare their pros and cons in order to help you make a more informed decision.Netflix is a streaming platform that has been around for a while and offers a large selection of both classic and contemporary titles. One of the biggest draws of Netflix is its library, which includes a range of popular movies and TV shows, as well as original content that is exclusive to the platform. However, the monthly subscription price can be costly, especially if you are not a heavy user.On the other hand, Amazon Prime Video offers a free 30-day trial period, which allows you to try out the platform and decide if it's worth the investment. It also has a large library of movies and TV shows, with a focus on original content. However, some users have reported issues with buffering and streaming quality.Hulu, on the other hand, offers a more cost-effective subscription plan that includes both live TV and on-demand content. It also has a wide selection of both classic and current movies and TV shows. However, it's important to note that Hulu is only available in the United States.In conclusion, each of these streaming services has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best option for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. I would recommend trying out the free trial periods of each platform to see which one fits your needs the best.</s>",

Netflix has an incredible selection, both in terms of classic and current content. Hulu also offers a decent variety, but it's more focused on modern content than classic content.I would recommend giving Netflix a try if you haven't already. If you have, then I would say give Amazon Prime a try as well. I think you'll be happy with either service.</s>"

            "<s> Can you provide guidance on a streaming service that excels in original content, with a focus on quality shows and movies across various genres?I'm trying to create a short list of services to show off on a website and I think I've got a good base, but I'd really like to find a service that stands out and I'd like to get some help with this as the services I've been looking at are all quite similar. I've tried to focus on the services I would personally consider, if I had to choose, and have taken note of their available content on various sites.I've looked at HBO Max, Disney+, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Crave, Shudder, Britbox and a few others, but I'm open to other recommendations if you have anything that really stands out. I would really like the service to have a wide range of original content, or at least a wide range of different kinds of content.What I have found is that the content is quite similar on the available services and my personal favourites at the moment are Shudder and Disney+. I've found it hard to come to an overall decision, though, and I don't want to pick just one of those two as they're both great, but the question remains whether there's another service that stands out that I may not have considered.Can anyone provide some guidance?posted by kittypurry to Media & Arts (12 answers total) 12 users marked this as a favoriteYouTube Premium.It's not like Netflix. They don't even bother to release new shows and movies in the US. It's entirely focused on the most amazing, fun, weird and diverse content that has no interest in appealing to the mainstream.I think it's actually the best value right now (especially if you don't want ads). You get an ad free youtube plus free access to the new and improved YouTube Music (and the regular old YouTube with ads if you really can't live without them).posted by 20yearlurkerson at 6:26 PM on June 26, 2021 [1 favorite]The new Star Trek shows are on Paramount+, which also has lots of Paramount movies in addition to original content and Paramount Network (formerly Spike, which has shows from Comedy Central, MTV, etc.).posted by Mavri at 6:29 PM on June 26, 2021 [1 favorite]Disney+ is all about the Disney stuff, right?posted by Cash4Lead at 6:30 PM on June 26, 2021You can check out this handy guide to the top 10 streaming services in Australia. I don't know if it's particularly relevant for your situation but it may be worth checking out.posted by ThePinkSuperhero at 6:38 PM on June 26, 2021If you are looking for a specific genre then HBO Max has the most shows. They are not all very good, and some are awful, but that seems to be par for the course these days with streaming services.posted by Dip Flash at 6:52 PM on June 26, 2021I agree that YouTube Premium is very good and unique. It doesn't have a huge amount of original content but the originals they do have are quite good. I personally have a subscription to both Disney+ and Amazon Prime and they are great but I have a very wide range of taste.The best thing about all of these streaming services (well, the one's I have experience with at least) is that they're not mutually exclusive. If you want to watch everything from a given service, you can subscribe to both.Having said that, I would still recommend HBO Max to your readers. While it might not have an incredible amount of variety (I think they are really focusing on the Max branding for their high quality content) it has the best original shows by far. Some of my favourite shows are now available on the platform.And you do have to choose one.posted by The Pluto Gangsta at 7:32 PM on June 26, 2021The BritBox app, though, is kind of awful. It doesn't seem to be available in all countries yet, so check if your country is one that is supported before getting too excited. If you want a BritBox experience without all the ads, though, it seems to be best to get the Chromecast with Google TV (with a few exceptions where they require your local country's version of Hulu, which has an app on the CwGTV).For some reason they have an odd habit of not working very well in browsers, despite having a website. I am in the UK and it won't let me login from Chrome or Edge, but works in Firefox.And also, it does have an Apple TV app.posted by 20yearlurkerson at 8:27 PM on June 26, 2021The new Star Trek shows are on Paramount+, which also has lots of Paramount movies in addition to original content and Paramount NetworkThere's a lot of really old Star Trek movies on Paramount+, but I don't think there are any new Star Trek shows. I think there's a documentary about the original series or something, but I'm not sure it actually counts.posted by dnash at 9:59 PM on June 26, 2021If you like Star Trek, I highly recommend The Orville, which is basically a Star Trek-style show with an even lower budget and even worse production values. I think it's fun, though.If you haven't heard of Rings of Power, I think that would be something that would appeal to a wide range of audiences, so I would highly recommend giving that a shot.posted by pjmoy at 12:22 AM on June 27, 2021I think you're looking for Peacock. It's got everything: The Office, Parks and Rec, Friends, and the complete run of SNL. It's got its own original content too, including the remake of Brave New World (which isn't bad) and the Peacemaker spin-off from the Suicide Squad film. It's also got live sports like NHL hockey, MLB baseball, and WWE. It's got everything.posted by gwint at 12:53 AM on June 27, 2021Yep, for BritBox (US) specifically, I had an old Roku that I had already used to subscribe to BritBox (UK) and I just unsubscribed and added on a US BritBox sub (using the Chromecast with Google TV as my sole streaming device). I was able to get a free month by linking up my Amazon Prime account and using their mobile app to check out.If you are looking for a specific genre then HBO Max has the most shows.This is not true. You could look up HBO Max's genre breakdown yourself.Their original shows are fine, but their non-original programming is just an extremely boring, safe slate.If you're looking for sci-fi, go with Netflix. They have a lot of excellent shows, and they also have the new Star Trek shows, The Orville, and many more. If you're looking for non-sci-fi, go with Disney+. It has all the Disney movies and the new Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic content. If you want comedy, go with HBO Max.If you're looking for \"a service that stands out and I'd like to get some help with this\" then go with Netflix.posted by gwint at 2:06 AM on June 27, 2021\u00ab Older How to convince a woman to move in with you? | What should I do about my car?

            "<s> Can you provide guidance on a streaming service that excels in original content, with a focus on quality shows and movies across various genres?I\u2019ve been an Amazon Prime Video subscriber since they acquired rights to distribute my favorite show (The Man in the High Castle).It\u2019s been a mixed bag since then. Prime Video is no longer my go-to platform for TV and film viewing. Here\u2019s why.1. Content quality is hit-and-missLet\u2019s face it: you can\u2019t expect every TV series and film to be a winner, but some are more consistent in their quality than others.While Amazon is good at providing high-quality original content, it\u2019s a bit lacking in the quantity department. Many of its original series and films don\u2019t hold up to the standard of some of their better shows and movies.2. Original content isn\u2019t always availableAnother issue I had with Amazon Prime Video is that its exclusive original content is not available for viewing everywhere.The majority of its original content is only available to viewers in the United States and a handful of other countries.For example, my favorite series, The Man in the High Castle, is only available in certain countries. While it\u2019s possible to purchase and stream the entire season, it\u2019s a hassle to go through the trouble of purchasing a subscription to the service.3. Content isn\u2019t always availableI\u2019ve also found that Amazon Prime Video content isn\u2019t always available to viewers in other countries.For example, if you\u2019re from a country that has access to the US version of the service, you may not have access to the original content that\u2019s not available in your country.This isn\u2019t a huge issue, but it can be frustrating when you\u2019re trying to watch a show or film that you\u2019re subscribed to, but isn\u2019t available in your country.4. Content isn\u2019t always available in HDAnother issue I\u2019ve encountered with Amazon Prime Video is that the content available in HD may not be available in your country.For example, if you\u2019re in the US and are subscribed to the service, you may not have access to the original content that\u2019s not available in your country.This is a huge problem, especially for those who are subscribed to the service and don\u2019t have access to the HD version of the content.5. Content isn\u2019t always available in 4KAnother issue I\u2019ve encountered with Amazon Prime Video is that the content available in 4K may not be available in your country.This isn\u2019t a huge issue, but it can be frustrating when you\u2019re trying to watch a show or film that you\u2019re subscribed to, but isn\u2019t available in your country.6. Content isn\u2019t always available in HDRAnother issue I\u2019ve encountered with Amazon Prime Video is that the content available in HDR may not be available in your country.This isn\u2019t a huge issue, but it can be frustrating when you\u2019re trying to watch a show or film that you\u2019re subscribed to, but isn\u2019t available in your country.In the end, I\u2019m still a happy Amazon Prime Video subscriber, but I\u2019ve had my fair share of issues with the service.If you\u2019re a fan of the service, I would still recommend it, but make sure to keep these issues in mind.If you\u2019re not a fan of the service, there are plenty of other options available, such as Netflix and HBO Now.Can you provide guidance on a streaming service that has a large selection of

            "<s> Could you recommend a streaming service that stands out for its family-friendly content, with a variety of options suitable for viewers of all ages?For a family-friendly streaming service, my go-to would be Hulu Plus. It offers the full line-up of Nickelodeon content for $8/month for ad-free service.What do you think are some of the best family-friendly shows, movies, and TV series out there right now?The first thing that comes to mind is Duck Dynasty, of course. It\u2019s just great family entertainment.In terms of family-friendly movies, I\u2019m going to recommend two: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Mr. Peabody and Sherman. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a 3D animated film that is available on Netflix. It has a lot of slapstick humor and a lot of silly, nonsensical action, but there are also some really profound things about appreciating the simple pleasures in life and realizing how things can become too serious when people don\u2019t take a step back and reassess the situation. It\u2019s also about a father who\u2019s dealing with his son moving away, and how he\u2019s able to find a way to reconnect with his son by inventing something that will ultimately make the world a better place.As for Mr. Peabody and Sherman, it is available on Hulu. It\u2019s a great example of how cartoons are no longer just for kids. They are for everyone. It is the modern version of a classic show. Mr. Peabody is a dog that can create time traveling devices so he takes Sherman around the world. The film has a lot of great slapstick humor as well.Another show I recommend is The Muppets. It was released on Disney Plus at the end of 2020 and has been streaming ever since. It is the first film of the series that doesn\u2019t feature any human characters, which was a bold move to take the Muppets back to their roots. It\u2019s a musical film, and you have Jim Henson\u2019s original puppets with some great new characters, like Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear. They come back to Hollywood with a new manager, and they get tangled up in all these crazy hijinks. It has all the classic Muppet songs, but also a lot of new stuff as well. It\u2019s really great for the whole family.Lastly, I\u2019d also recommend checking out Adventure Time. It\u2019s a show that first appeared on Cartoon Network, but was picked up by HBO Max. It\u2019s a classic fantasy animated series that is about a boy, Finn, who lives in a post-apocalyptic world. It takes place in a town called the Land of Ooo, and it\u2019s all about him trying to figure out who he is and what he wants to be. It\u2019s one of the first fantasy series for kids that have a strong moral message.What\u2019s your favorite family-friendly movie or TV show?My all-time favorite family-friendly show is the original Star Trek, and my all-time favorite family-friendly movie is Home Alone.You can find all these shows on the Disney Plus streaming service. They\u2019re all available for free with a free trial. You can also watch them on HBO Max and Amazon Prime Video.What do you think are some of the best family-friendly shows and movies available on streaming services right now?The best family-friendly show right now is Home Alone.The best family-friendly movie right now is The Grinch.The best family-friendly show right now is Family Matters.The best family-friendly movie right now is Home Alone.The best family-friendly show right now is Step by Step.The best family-friendly movie right now is E.T.

It was also a big hit in my family. My parents would always watch it together. I remember that my parents would always say that they didn\u2019t watch it because it was boring.The Brady Bunch is a really great show.

            "<s> Could you recommend a streaming service that stands out for its family-friendly content, with a variety of options suitable for viewers of all ages? There are several on the market, so I\u2019m curious to know what you think.Dear Curious: With so many streaming services to choose from, it can be difficult to know where to start.According to research, 68% of Americans subscribe to at least one streaming service, with the most popular being Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max, and Peacock. These services have something for everyone, from classic movies and TV shows to original content and live sports.When it comes to family-friendly options, Disney+ and Netflix are two of the most popular choices. Disney+ is a great option for families with young children, as it has a wide range of kid-friendly content, including classic Disney movies, Pixar films, and Star Wars series. Netflix, on the other hand, has a more diverse range of content, including children\u2019s shows, live-action and animated movies, and documentaries.For families looking for a more budget-friendly option, Hulu is a good choice. It offers a wide range of TV shows, movies, and original programming, including family-friendly content like the animated series Bob\u2019s Burgers and the documentary series Finding Ohana.If you\u2019re looking for a streaming service that is specifically tailored to families, there are a few options to consider. For example, PBS Kids is a great option for families with young children, as it offers a wide range of educational and entertaining programming.However, the best way to find the right streaming service for your family is to do your research and try out different options. Consider your budget, the types of content that you and your family are interested in, and any specific requirements that you may have.Overall, there are many streaming services that offer a wide range of family-friendly content, so don\u2019t be afraid to experiment and find the one that best suits your needs.Dear Ms. Demeanor: I have a friend who has a habit of making negative comments about people, and it\u2019s becoming a problem. He seems to take joy in criticizing others, and it\u2019s getting to be a bit much.When I try to have a conversation with him about it, he gets defensive and dismisses my concerns, so I\u2019m at a loss as to how to handle the situation. What should I do?Dear Feeling Faint: It\u2019s not uncommon for people to make negative comments about others, and it can be difficult to know how to handle the situation. However, there are a few things you can do to try to address the issue.First, you can try to have a conversation with your friend about his comments and how they might make others feel. Explain that you have noticed that he tends to make negative comments about others, and that you would like him to consider how his words might affect others.Another option is to try to redirect the conversation. If your friend is making negative comments about someone, you can try to shift the conversation to a more positive topic. You could say something like, \u201cInstead of focusing on the negative, let\u2019s talk about something positive that happened today.\u201dIf your friend continues to make negative comments, it may be necessary to address the issue more directly. You can try to express your concerns in a calm and respectful manner, and explain that you are not trying to attack him but simply want him to consider how his words might impact others.It\u2019s important to remember that not everyone is going to react well to criticism, and some people may become defensive or aggressive in response. If your friend becomes defensive or hostile, it\u2019s best to walk away from the conversation and focus on having a positive interaction with him at a later time.Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your relationship with your friend and the specific circumstances of the situation. If the negative comments are causing tension or conflict in your relationship, it may be necessary to have a more direct conversation about the issue. However, if your friend is just a bit of a negative Nellie and you\u2019re able to address the issue in a calm and respectful manner, there\u2019s a good chance that things can improve over time.Dear Ms. Demeanor: My mother recently passed away, and I\u2019m having difficulty dealing with the grief. I feel like I should be able to get past this, but it just doesn\u2019t seem to be happening.How long does it take to get over a loss like this?Dear Lonely and Lost: Losing a loved one is never easy, and the grieving process can take a long time to work through. The amount of time it takes to get over a loss will vary from person to person, and there is no timeline that everyone must follow.It\u2019s normal to feel a range of emotions after a loss, including sadness, anger, and guilt. These feelings can be intense at first, but they will likely lessen over time as you begin to adjust to your new reality.One of the most important things you can do during this time is to be kind to yourself and allow yourself to feel the pain of your loss. Don\u2019t try to suppress your emotions or push them away. Instead, allow yourself to feel them and express them in healthy ways, such as through journaling or speaking with a therapist.You may also find it helpful to connect with other people who are grieving. Sharing your experience with others can provide support and help you feel less alone.Finally, be patient with yourself as you go through the grieving process. There is no right or wrong way to grieve, and you may not be able to move on from your loss right away. Allow yourself time to heal, and don\u2019t be afraid to seek help if you feel overwhelmed by your emotions.Overall, losing a loved one is a difficult and painful experience, but with time and support, you will be able to find your way to a place of peace and healing.I hope you find these answers helpful, dear readers. Remember that everyone\u2019s situation is unique, so please be sure to seek out the advice of a professional counselor or therapist if you need additional support.Don\u2019t forget to tune in to my live weekly broadcast, \u201cThe Demeanor Hour with Tara Rose,\u201d every Tuesday from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. EST, as we discuss a wide range of topics from relationships to career advice and everything in between.

My streaming app of choice is Amazon Prime, but I\u2019m always looking for other options for families. The free trials, monthly plans, and annual plans vary considerably, so I want to do some comparison shopping before signing up.Streaming media is the preferred choice for many television viewers, especially parents with small children. We spend most of our lives streaming audio, reading e-books, watching movies and videos, listening to music, and surfing the Internet, but not always in the same manner. Streaming media refers to digital media that is continuously delivered to a user, whether on a mobile phone, computer, tablet, or television. Streaming media is a form of web-based media, but that\u2019s where the similarities end.Streaming video is one of the best ways to watch movies, television shows, and live events on your phone, tablet, or computer. Streaming video has become so popular that it now accounts for more than 75 percent of all internet traffic. Streaming video is defined as continuous transmission of content, without any storage on a hard drive. This can be accomplished by using peer-to-peer technology or server-based technology. Peer-to-peer streaming refers to a type of content sharing where users can share their media files with each other. A peer-to-peer file sharing program uses the internet to search for other computers that have the file you are searching for. It then copies the files to those computers.Streaming services offer a variety of content for families. They also offer a variety of subscription plans and add-on services. Some offer ad-free streams, others do not, and some even include movies or television shows that you can rent. It is important to consider the benefits and drawbacks of each type of service, including the types of media available, the streaming device you want to use, and your budget. There are several ways to cut costs when choosing a streaming service, and you can find more information in our guide on free trials for streaming services.We looked at the top family-friendly streaming services that offer content for children, teens, and adults.

We looked at a variety of factors to see if any streaming service stood out from the rest, including how much content they offer for different age groups, how many channels they offer, and how much each service costs.How to Choose the Right Streaming Service for FamiliesIf you are looking for a streaming service that is suitable for all ages, you will want to consider whether the service provides content that is appropriate for your child. You will also want to consider whether the service has parental controls.Most streaming services are not suitable for children because they do not offer the right level of parental control. For example, some services allow children to watch certain movies or TV shows, but they do not allow them to watch others. Some services have an age rating, but they don\u2019t have a parental control feature.If you want to use a streaming service that is suitable for all ages, you will want to look at the parental control features.

Just stream from the app and be done with it.I use Amazon and use my own music stored in Google Play Music and it works great.Yeah I have tried and cancelled Amazon Music and Google Music.I have Amazon prime which has music but I don't think it counts as a \"music streaming\" service as it is not the same as Spotify, Google, Apple, etc.Amazon does not count as music streaming service because you need Amazon prime subscription to listen to music there and it is not unlimited listening as Spotify is.</s>",

Thankfully, I have a VPN and can watch movies from any country without any restrictions.I can\u2019t think of any platforms that I think are too difficult to use or hard to navigate. But for me it is a personal opinion. There is always an app, a site or an interface that is difficult to use. I have also seen different apps that people find difficult to navigate.On the contrary, I have seen different people find the same app easy to use. It's all in your taste. There are plenty of sites with an unfriendly interface, or it is too difficult to understand the logic behind their features. But that's just a minor flaw and people find no problem in using it.It's just personal preferences, like me I prefer a more easy to understand and intuitive interface. It helps me save my time to get the information I want in a short time. But that's just me. I'm not saying others have to like it. Everyone has their own preferences.It's all a matter of personal preference. There are many streaming platforms, but for me, Netflix is the best. It has an easy-to-use interface, intuitive navigation, and a vast collection of movies and TV shows. Plus, it's available in many countries, so I can watch whatever I want, whenever I want. Other streaming platforms I like are Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and HBO Max.</s>",

With its huge library of movies and TV shows, it's hard to beat. However, it doesn't offer much in the way of international content. That's where streaming services like Amazon Prime and Hulu come in.

Any recommendations for a streaming service that provides a diverse array of movies and TV shows from different countries?I'm not sure that I would say Netflix has a lot of foreign programming that I'd recommend. The thing that Netflix has to offer is they do have all of the old episodes of a lot of tv shows from the UK. They have a fair number of BBC shows but they don't have a lot of movies or series produced in other countries. I think Amazon Prime has a pretty good assortment of foreign content. Their original series like Jack Ryan are produced in other countries and that was filmed in Europe so if you like European culture and you're into that kind of stuff, you might want to check that out.Well, there's some foreign films you can get on Netflix. I don't know if you want to say they're great. But there are quite a few foreign films you can get there. I think there is also an app called Kanopy that is basically a library of free films. It is an ad supported site but you can find some great movies on there.There is a site that you might want to check out. It is called Mubi. They do have movies from Europe and Japan and stuff like that. They're not new, they're classic films. You can sign up for a 30-day free trial there and then it is $6.99 a month. They do not have a lot of content, but the ones they do have are great movies.I would also check out Hulu.

So not much in the way of British TV.- BBC iPlayer has lots of documentaries, but most of it is only available if you have a UK IP address (at least that's the case for me).I'm in the US and I can recommend BBC iPlayer and Netflix. BBC iPlayer has a pretty good selection of documentaries, most of which I've found to be fairly well produced and engaging.

Are there any platforms known for delivering top-notch streaming quality and resolution?Re: Streaming ServicesAmazon Prime video is 4k and Amazon music is also 4k, but i am not sure if the music has a higher sample rate or bit rate.I'm guessing that the bit rate is a lower one on music streaming apps because they would use compression like any normal music.</s>",
            "<s> I'm in the market for a streaming service that prioritizes high-quality audio and video streaming. Are there any platforms known for delivering top-notch streaming quality and resolution?I'm mostly interested in services that prioritize quality streaming over cost.This is a highly subjective question. But a place to start is YouTube TV or Netflix, but not the cheapest. YouTube TV, at $55/month, is expensive compared to cable or satellite. However, they use Google's servers for the streaming and have their own video encoder to deliver a good picture quality. Netflix has their own encoder too and they have a 4K plan for $18/month. Both are great quality. YouTube TV has a bunch of channels, but it is more geared toward entertainment. Netflix is more for watching movies and TV.What is your internet connection speed and what type of devices are you using to access this service?I have a 50-50 split between mobile/web and TV. My internet is about 150/15 and I live in a relatively rural area (so not the best connections are available). I would prefer to avoid Netflix due to the \"Netflix tax\" on the device. So, I don't care to have 4K and don't mind 1080p. I want a service that has good streaming quality. I will occasionally need to stream over WiFi, but mostly over cellular connections.I've heard of using the \"download to device\" feature and I'll probably use that for some titles, but I don't mind downloading stuff over a wired connection.I was just looking at Hulu today and they're offering a limited amount of channels that they're able to use because they use the cable/satellite connections to provide the channel feeds to the service. But, they have a really cheap plan that has no ads and only a limited amount of streaming quality. But, it's a good choice for streaming over WiFi since they don't have ads. They also have a Live TV option which provides the same channel feeds as cable/satellite providers, but you pay for a plan which includes those channels.You don't mention a price you're willing to pay.I can get YouTube TV for $55/month. And, that is all I need (for now) and has a good library of movies.I'm just a little frustrated with Netflix's \"Netflix Tax\". It's $13/month for 4K. Which is ridiculous.I'd love to hear about other streaming services that are good and inexpensive.</s>",

            "<s> I'm in the market for a streaming service that prioritizes high-quality audio and video streaming. Are there any platforms known for delivering top-notch streaming quality and resolution?The term \u201cstreaming\u201d is often used interchangeably with \u201cstreaming video.\u201d However, it is worth noting that, aside from video-streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO Now, there are also streaming audio-only services out there.You can check out the streaming options available to you on the streaming service comparison chart here.For this particular guide, however, we will focus on video-streaming services.

I'll definitely check them out.I have a bit of a subscription for both Netflix and Amazon Prime. I use Amazon mostly for the free two day shipping. As far as films are concerned Netflix seems to have a pretty good mix. But I would not depend upon that.Amazon Prime is the only place where I stream anything. I have a Prime membership for the shipping and because I don't have to buy a Roku stick like I do for Netflix. I love Amazon's streaming, even though I have to have a Roku stick for the Netflix service that I don't want.The best way to watch independent films is probably to check out your local independent theater. The prices are often less than a single showing at a multiplex and you get to watch them on a real screen. Plus, you can watch independent films at a real theater without even having to leave your home!I can't even watch my own movies on Amazon without a Roku stick. My phone and tablet and computer all work. I know they don't want to support the older models, but if they would allow an option to download their app and use it that way, I would happily pay the monthly fee.You can't? Really? I thought you could. And I don't have a Roku stick, but have Prime. Are you sure you can't stream Prime content from a non-Roku device?No, I can't watch Amazon's streaming movies on my phone.

            "<s> I'm a fan of immersive and original series. Can you recommend a streaming service that consistently produces compelling and critically acclaimed original series across various genres?A) You need to choose between Netflix and Amazon Prime. Neither is a cheap date, but both offer quality, diverse, and engaging content across a wide range of genres.B) But first you need to do the hard yards and sign up for a free trial with both services, so you can experience and compare for yourself.I'm going to suggest Netflix. Netflix is more of a binge-on-TV-shows service than a binge-on-movies service, and I'm one of those people who wants to feel like I'm binge-watching when I'm watching TV. For me, that means I want to watch multiple episodes in a row, and it also means I'm interested in watching more than one show at a time. So, binge-on-movies service HBO and I aren't a great fit, even though they're the best at what they do.The great thing about Netflix is they offer a range of TV shows across multiple genres, from a range of countries. You can binge on Stranger Things, Black Mirror, Master of None, and Orange Is the New Black; get the whole family together to watch Stranger Things and Master of None; get the whole family together to watch Star Wars: The Clone Wars; have a serious debate about the value of socialism and the validity of racial stereotypes with Orange Is the New Black; watch a range of documentaries; and stream movies as long as you're not trying to watch multiple movies at once. I watch Netflix a lot, because they have a range of shows I can watch at the same time, and I can stream in HD and even UHD.I'm not saying you'll be as keen on all of the shows on Netflix, but if you take a chance on one or two, I think you'll enjoy your binge-watching experience.As for shows you might not have heard of, try Altered Carbon, Love, Dear White People, Atypical, Bloodline, Narcos, The Get Down, House of Cards, and Arrested Development.And, finally, as for genres: Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Crime, Horror, Documentary, Romance, Sci-Fi, Kids, and Animated.But be warned, because of their wide range, Netflix is expensive.</s>",

Can you recommend a streaming service that consistently produces compelling and critically acclaimed original series across various genres?-Karen M., St. Paul, MinnesotaYou want binge-worthy, critically acclaimed series across different genres? You\u2019re not alone.In 2020, Netflix streamed a whopping 400 million hours of its original series worldwide each week. HBO Max, its closest competitor, came in with 140 million hours each week.While Netflix\u2019s \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cBridgerton\u201d and HBO Max\u2019s \u201cLove Life\u201d and \u201cLegally Blonde\u201d have racked up accolades and attention in recent months, there are more streaming services vying for your attention.From Apple to Roku and Quibi to Disney+, streaming services are creating a glut of content. And some of it is pretty good. So, let\u2019s get started.Apple TV+ has an impressive slate of originals, including the Oscar-nominated \u201cThe Elephant Whisperers\u201d and \u201cCODA\u201d and the hit \u201cTed Lasso.\u201d But it\u2019s also home to shows such as \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d which received 20 Emmy nominations, and \u201cServant,\u201d starring Toby Kebbell and Rupert Grint.The latter is a spooky show about a family that comes to life after a supernatural experience with a nanny. It\u2019s not for the squeamish and features disturbing violence. It\u2019s worth watching, but it\u2019s not for everyone.Because Apple TV+ is available as part of Apple\u2019s $15-a-month subscription package, it\u2019s probably not the best place for the newcomer looking to sample different streaming services.In addition to Ted Lasso, Apple TV+ offers originals such as the thriller \"Severance\" and the drama \"WeCrashed.\" And if you're looking for more of a family-friendly lineup, Apple TV+ has \"Central Park\" and \"The Shrink Next Door,\" starring Will Ferrell.Disney+ is one of the best streaming services around, and its original series are often among the best. Some of the most popular shows on Disney+ include \u201cWandaVision,\u201d \u201cLoki,\u201d and \u201cThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier.\u201dWhile these shows are geared toward adults, they do have a fair amount of kid-friendly content as well.

Can you recommend a streaming service that consistently produces compelling and critically acclaimed original series across various genres?Answered byJoe LeBlanc, Media ConsultantApril 20, 2019Netflix is a great place to start, but unfortunately, you\u2019re going to have to pay for it.Netflix is a great place to start, but unfortunately, you\u2019re going to have to pay for it. It is home to Stranger Things, Black Mirror, and a whole lot more. The problem is that the streaming service has been spending so much on content that it has been raising prices. Right now, Netflix is $13 a month. However, it is about to jump to $16 a month. In my opinion, that is way too much for a service like this. I have a suggestion for a replacement, but it is going to cost you more than Netflix.Hulu is an amazing streaming service. It\u2019s available to stream on just about every streaming device. The service starts at $6 a month. This gives you access to over 35 live TV channels. The service also offers more than 600 TV shows. This includes a lot of great original shows. Right now, there are 46 original shows streaming on Hulu. These include The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Castle Rock, The Looming Tower, Marvel\u2019s Runaways, and more. The cost for Hulu Plus Live TV is $45 a month.
