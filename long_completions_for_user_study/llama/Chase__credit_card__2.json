        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.In the last few months I have had to use both my AMEX Green and Chase Sapphire Preferred credit cards quite a bit. I'm not sure I like the amount of money I've spent. What I like, however, is the flexibility they offer me. The perks and free travel make the high interest rate on the AMEX Green card more than worth it. I'm currently in Europe and have a good amount of money on my Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card that I will not be able to use until I return to the United States. I know that I have a high interest rate on this credit card, but I can pay it back without penalty if I want to. This type of flexibility makes this credit card great in my book.I don't know which credit card is better for you, but I'm hoping that I can find out from your answers. Let me know which credit card you use and how it works for you in the comments section below.Do you carry multiple credit cards?</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I want to make the most out of my financial assets in the coming year. I have a lot of debt, but I have the ability to get rid of a lot of it. I am looking at several different options including Discover, Chase, and a couple other options. It would be nice to get a card with good bonuses to help me cover some of my bills. I've heard a lot about Discover. It offers good bonuses and a reasonable interest rate, but I don't know about their customer service. I'm hoping to get a card that is affordable to use. Thanks for the information.Re: Help Me Find the Best Credit Cardby Kwisatz \u00bb Thu Jan 24, 2013 3:35 amIf you want low interest rate you will need to get a secured card. I'd recommend a secured Chase card.by khaled2110 \u00bb Thu Jan 24, 2013 5:10 amI don't know why you're looking for so many things in one credit card. Just pick the one that is going to best fit your needs. If you're looking for the lowest interest rate, then I agree with Kwisatz - get a secured card from Chase. It's not only a good secured card, but it also rewards you as you get your finances together and pay off the card.by jerseygirl \u00bb Thu Jan 24, 2013 10:56 amkhaled2110 wrote: I don't know why you're looking for so many things in one credit card.

It sounds to me like a credit card is not what you need. If you could pay off all your credit cards, it would be the better choice, as you don't have to worry about being hit by a big interest payment at the end of the month. You can put some of the money you get from your bonuses towards paying down your debt. It will go a lot further and you won't have to worry about the interest.by Caitlin \u00bb Fri Jan 25, 2013 3:55 pmI'd just go with whatever bank you already use for checking and savings, unless you have a specific need for a particular benefit or service that another credit card issuer might have.</s>",

In a situation like that, the only thing that you can do is apply for a card, charge up as much as you can, pay the minimum balance due, and hope that you can work your way out of debt.It's a dangerous financial strategy, and you don't want to do that. You have a lot of credit available to you. Don't let it go to waste. If you're going to get a new credit card, you should take advantage of it and find a credit card that will reward you for using it.I'm going to recommend a few cards that you may want to consider.I'm not going to recommend a credit card that offers a 0% APR introductory rate. That's a nice benefit to have, but that's not the kind of credit card I would recommend for someone with bad credit. I don't recommend cards that have high interest rates.Here are a few that I'd like to share with you:I'd like to recommend the Chase Freedom. It's a decent credit card, and it's got a low APR. The interest rate is just 14.99%, but I don't like the fact that you have to pay it off in full in 20 months.This is a good card to consider if you're going to be able to use it responsibly.Another good card to consider is the BankAmericard Cash Rewards. It's a great card to use to earn cash back rewards. It's got a decent interest rate and a $0 annual fee.The BankAmericard Cash Rewards is one of the best credit cards for bad credit. You can use it to build your credit, and the interest rate is relatively low.Another card to consider is the Capital One Quicksilver. It's a good card to use to earn travel rewards. It has a 15.99% interest rate, and it has a $0 annual fee.These cards are all great options for someone with a bad credit score.You said that you're planning on getting a mortgage, so I'd like to recommend a mortgage lender that I've had good luck with:The last thing I want to mention is a free financial adviser:I hope you found these recommendations useful.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.To me it seems that there are four distinct credit cards that offer these benefits:Discover it (Chase Sapphire Preferred)US Bank (Citi Double Cash)Discover it (Chase Freedom Unlimited)Amazon Prime (Chase Amazon Rewards)I'm looking for an authoritative opinion on which of these cards is the best one for everyday spending, but which offers the best return on major purchases (especially international travel, as that's what I'd be using it for most frequently.)So, for example, if Discover It (Chase Sapphire Preferred) offers the best combination of points and perks, but if you wanted to put 20k on it in one shot it would cost you 2%, then would that be worth it?EDIT: As of now, I've got my Discover It (Chase Sapphire Preferred), my US Bank (Citi Double Cash), my Amex EveryDay, and my Discover it (Chase Freedom Unlimited) cards. The Freedom Unlimited offers the best return per $ spent, but I'm wondering if the cashback is worth sacrificing the other benefits and points for some major purchases, like say a plane ticket to Europe.I'm also wondering if the Chase Amazon Rewards is a decent one to keep since it's just so easy to earn points from shopping at Amazon.credit-card rewards cash-backAsked another way, is there any real point to having multiple credit cards that all offer roughly the same benefits? The Chase cards have pretty similar benefits, as do the Amex ones. I have a few different cards, but I'm wondering if there's any major benefit to having more than a couple. \u2013 Andrew Russell Mar 2 '17 at 18:51In most cases, no. However, sometimes having multiple cards can help to maximize your rewards. \u2013 Michael Lai\u2666 Mar 2 '17 at 18:53Is there any difference between Discover and Discover it in regards to rewards? \u2013 Andrew Russell Mar 2 '17 at 18:55@AndrewRussell They both have a 1.5% cash back rewards program. The \"it\" refers to the fact that the card has an \"it\" in its name. The Discover card doesn't. \u2013 JoeTaxpayer\u2666 Mar 2 '17 at 19:07In some cases it may be worth paying the 5% foreign transaction fee on the Discover it Chase Sapphire Preferred card, if you don't have the US Bank Citi Double Cash. It will cost you $27 if you spend $1000 in foreign transactions on this card. \u2013 Grade 'Eh' Bowman Mar 2 '17 at 21:02I think the key thing here is to get the right one. That's the card that gives you the best value for what you want to buy.For me that means:Miles and points: Chase Sapphire PreferredTravel Rewards: Amex EveryDayRestaurant purchases: Amex EveryDayGrocery Purchases: Chase Sapphire PreferredCash Back: Chase Freedom UnlimitedNow, I'm in a little bit of an unusual situation here because I have no interest in getting travel rewards. So the Chase Sapphire Preferred is really just giving me an opportunity to earn extra points on stuff I would normally buy anyway. The only things I buy with the Amex card are groceries (which I buy every week) and a bit of travel. And, while I do eat at restaurants, I don't use my Amex card there. (I have a Capital One card for that.)If you are using the points to get travel rewards, the Chase Sapphire Preferred might not be as valuable.I have the Sapphire Preferred and I do use it for travel - I just book through a travel agent and then use the points to offset the cost. It seems like I use my Chase Sapphire Preferred about twice a year to book travel - that being said, I have never booked travel through the Chase Ultimate Rewards site. \u2013 Nate Mar 2 '17 at 21:30The Sapphire Preferred is great for travel in general. You can just book hotel stays and use the points. Or you can book travel through Chase's portal and use the points for anything. \u2013 JoeTaxpayer\u2666 Mar 3 '17 at 17:48Yes. You can use your points for anything. There is no restriction on what you use them for. It is simply easier to get the \"best value\" if you book travel. (Or you can use the points for merchandise and gift cards, but there is no point in doing that because you can simply use the points to pay for that merchandise and get a 10% discount.) \u2013 JoeTaxpayer\u2666 Mar 3 '17 at 17:52The Discover it Chase Sapphire Preferred is the best for most situations, and there is no significant difference in the benefits between the two.I personally have the Discover it Chase Sapphire Preferred. I have used it a handful of times for large purchases and had no problem getting the bonus at $5,000.Discover has had some very attractive signup bonuses on a couple of occasions, but the current one is too low for me. However, if you are able to use the card and get the 5x points per dollar in rotating categories, it is very nice. In fact, I've earned 25k+ points in just a few months of use. That's enough for 3-5 flights around the world (assuming you don't take a long trip).The Chase Freedom Unlimited is great for everyday spending, and the 1.5% cash back is not bad, especially if you don't have other 1.5% cards. I have it because I had the card that was discontinued, but I am considering downgrading.The US Bank Citi Double Cash and Amex Everyday are both great cards as well. I am looking at the US Bank Citi Double Cash for a few reasons:Earn 2x on everything (but no bonus category)15 month 0% introductory APR on purchases (after that, the APR is 14.99% - 24.99%)Flat 2% cash back on all purchasesThe US Bank Citi Double Cash is the only card that offers a 0% APR, which is really nice for someone who wants to put down a large amount and keep interest to a minimum.The Amex Everyday offers 2x points for purchases in the US at U.S. restaurants, on U.S. purchases at U.S. gas stations and U.S. supermarkets. This is also the only one that offers 10% bonus points on everyday purchases, so you get 20x points per dollar spent in those categories.The Amex Everyday does not offer any intro APRs, but it does not offer the 15 month 0% intro APR like the US Bank Citi Double Cash.The Chase Amazon Rewards offers 2% cash back, but the \"cash back\" is in the form of redeemable Amazon.com gift cards. I use the Amazon Rewards primarily for my Amazon purchases. But I have used it for other purchases where I know I will receive a lot of reward points back (such as Amazon gift cards). If you only use it to buy Amazon items, then I don't think the 2% cash back is bad at all.I am in a situation similar to you, and it is best for you to use the card that gives you the best value for what you are buying. I know that is the Sapphire Preferred, but you should decide what gives you the best value.You also have to weigh in your spending habits and your future spending. I find that the Freedom Unlimited is good for most of my spending.I find it easier to earn rewards by using the Discover it Chase Sapphire Preferred, and when I travel, I use the Discover it Chase Sapphire Preferred.I like having my Discover it Chase Sapphire Preferred, but I am considering downgrading it to the Freedom Unlimited.Andrew RussellAndrew RussellIf you use your Amex EveryDay at restaurants, that will cost you 2% (2x points = 1 point, since 1 point = 1 cent for every dollar spent). \u2013 JoeTaxpayer\u2666 Mar 2 '17 at 19:09Thanks. I updated the answer to reflect the 2x points = 1 point. I guess I was overthinking it :) \u2013 Andrew Russell Mar 2 '17 at 19:11Not the answer you're looking for?

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I'd love to hear your personal opinions on this topic.Whenever I'm given a choice between paying by cash or by credit, I always opt to use my credit card, even when I don't have to pay a dime on it. This is because I am not paying the bill in full every month, and the interest rate on my credit card is actually much lower than my savings account.So what kind of card would you use?Would you use a travel rewards card that lets you cash in for free flights or hotel stays?Would you choose a rewards card that gives you a certain percentage back on every purchase you make?Would you choose a card that's a combination of both, offering a certain percentage cash back and the ability to redeem rewards for free flights or hotel stays?Or would you choose a low interest rate card that doesn't offer many perks?How do you select the right card for your needs?In my opinion, the best credit card to have is a low interest rate card. That way, if I decide to go on a shopping spree, and I can't pay the balance in full that month, I know I won't be penalized with a sky high interest rate on my card. But, I would also like to earn a little extra cash back here and there.I like a travel rewards credit card, but one that does not have an annual fee attached. I do not like to pay for rewards I earn. I want my rewards to come free of charge!For me, a low interest card is the perfect combination of a low interest rate and the ability to earn cash back and rewards.A low interest rate card is very important to me. I do not have a lot of debt, and I always pay my bill in full, so I do not worry about interest too much. But, I also would not want to be limited to only certain rewards and cash back offers.I think a low interest rate card is the best option for me. But, I also like that there are travel rewards cards out there, so that if I do decide to travel, I can get a percentage of my money back.I like a rewards card, but I am also concerned about interest rates. If I was given the option of paying an annual fee for cash back, I would rather pay that fee than have a low interest rate that ends up costing me a lot in the long run.I prefer the low interest rate card, but I also would like the option of cash back.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. What would you consider the best credit card for frequent travelers? And the best for students? And the best for people with bad credit? For everyday purchases?I'll be honest with you, I don't have the best track record when it comes to credit cards.I've had at least three credit cards over the past decade, and I've had an on-and-off love-hate relationship with each one. I've accumulated about $5000 in credit card debt over the years, which is no small feat for a person who once had credit score in the high 800s.I was so obsessed with my credit score for so long, it became an obsession that eventually ruined my financial well-being. It became all-consuming, and ultimately, all-consumed. I found myself spending $1200 on a pair of shoes I couldn't afford, and I justified my purchases to myself, by telling myself I was doing it for my credit score. I would tell myself, \"This is good for my credit score, because I'm building my credit score and I can use it later in life to take advantage of things like low interest rates and free flights.\"It took me a long time to recover financially from that debt, and I still have bad memories of it.In the years that followed my worst financial mistake, I learned that most credit cards are like relationships. They're not always good, they're not always bad. They can be great at some times, and horrible at others. Sometimes, they're worth every penny of the money you're paying for them. Other times, they're terrible. You have to make a judgement call about which cards are right for you at which points in your financial life. You can't always choose the right card, and you can't always avoid the wrong card, but you can be smart about how you use them and how you choose them.I've learned some good lessons in my years of credit card usage, and I've come to a few conclusions. Here's what I would tell you, if I were your best friend.1) If you're in debt and have credit card debt, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to fix a bad situation and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.I don't recommend paying off your credit card debt with a credit card. You'll be back in debt in no time if you use that same card, but that's not the goal. I recommend paying it off with money you've saved, money you've earned through a side-hustle, or money from a loan you've taken out. You can't get that money with a credit card. You can't get it with a debit card, either. You can only get it with money.2) If you're looking to build credit, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just looking to build your credit, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.3) If you're looking for rewards, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just looking for rewards, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.4) If you're trying to improve your financial situation, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to improve your financial situation, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.5) If you're looking for cashback, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just looking for cashback, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.6) If you're looking to pay off your student loan debt, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to pay off your student loan debt, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.7) If you're looking to pay off your car loan, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to pay off your car loan, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.8) If you're looking to pay off your mortgage, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to pay off your mortgage, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.9) If you're looking to pay off your credit card debt, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to pay off your credit card debt, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.10) If you're looking to pay off your credit card debt, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to pay off your credit card debt, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.I hope that list helps you understand that I'm not trying to shame people into not using credit cards. I'm trying to tell you how to use credit cards, and how to pick the right cards for you.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I've already discussed my favorite credit cards for travel rewards and how the Chase Sapphire Preferred is the best credit card for the average person, but I thought it would be interesting to talk about other types of credit cards as well.In this case, I wanted to compare the best credit cards for building credit, the best credit cards for those with a limited credit history, and the best credit cards for college students.I'm going to make a few assumptions here: 1) You are 18 years or older. 2) You aren't looking for a credit card that earns travel rewards. 3) You haven't been rejected for a credit card in the past.For these reasons, I am not including Discover It cards, which are specifically designed for those with fair or bad credit.The Best Credit Cards for Those With No Credit HistoryIn my opinion, the best credit cards for those with no credit history are the Capital One Platinum credit card and the Capital One Secured Mastercard.The Capital One Platinum card is the best card for those with no credit history because it gives you an immediate $500 line of credit with no annual fee. You also get 1% cash back on every purchase and you can upgrade to a rewards card once you establish a credit history and can qualify.The Capital One Secured Mastercard is also a great credit card for people with no credit history. With this card, you can put down a security deposit equal to your credit limit. If you keep up with your payments, you'll be given a regular credit card that will be reported to the credit bureaus after one year of responsible credit behavior.Capital One also has another secured credit card, the Capital One Secured Mastercard, that only requires a $49 deposit. However, the card only earns rewards at a rate of 1.25% and does not allow you to upgrade to a rewards credit card.The Best Credit Cards for College StudentsCapital One is also the best credit card for college students. The Capital One Journey Student Credit Card is designed specifically for college students with no credit history. It gives you $0 fraud liability protection and a credit line of $0 to $2,000, based on your creditworthiness.College students can also apply for the Discover it for Students card. Like the Discover It cards, this card is specifically designed for those with fair or bad credit. However, it still has a great rewards program that will appeal to many college students. You earn 5% cash back on your first $1,500 spent in rotating categories each quarter, 1% cash back on all other purchases, and 2% cash back on your first $200 in combined gas and restaurant purchases. It also features a $0 annual fee.You can also apply for the Discover it Student chrome card if you have an eligible student checking account. This card offers the same rewards program as the Discover it for Students card, but requires no annual fee.The Best Credit Cards for Limited Credit HistoriesWhen it comes to the best credit cards for people with limited credit histories, the Capital One QuicksilverOne card is the best option.You can apply for this card after only six months of good credit behavior, which means you don't need to have a lot of credit history to qualify. You also get 1.5% cash back on every purchase.The Discover it secured card is another great option. In addition to the rewards program I mentioned above, you also get a free FICO score and an automatic $0 annual fee if you have a qualifying credit score.You can also apply for the Discover it Chrome for Students card if you have a checking account that qualifies.You can also consider applying for the Capital One QuicksilverOne card if you have a good credit history, but want to build up your credit in the future. You can apply for the Capital One QuicksilverOne card after only 6 months of responsible credit behavior.This card is ideal for college students and those with no credit history. It also has a great rewards program and no annual fee.Finally, you can apply for the Discover it secured card if you have a good credit history. In addition to the rewards program I mentioned above, you also get a free FICO score and an automatic $0 annual fee if you have a qualifying credit score.If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment below.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.It's a pretty big question to tackle in just one post, so I decided to tackle it in a three-part series.Part 1: The 7 Best Credit Cards of 2016. Part 2: The 5 Worst Credit Cards of 2016. Part 3: The 5 Most Rewarding Credit Cards of 2016.There are dozens of credit cards on the market that claim to be the \"best.\" Some credit cards are great, while others are awful.Below you'll find my list of the five credit cards that I consider to be the best for a variety of reasons, such as rewards, signup bonuses, cash back, and more.These cards are great for those that don't have strong credit scores, but you should also be aware that each card carries an annual fee (at least the first year, and maybe longer) so make sure you can afford it.This card is known as the \"Gold Standard\" credit card. It offers 2% cash back on all purchases and also provides other great benefits, like a 0% introductory APR on balance transfers and purchases for 21 months and a $200 signup bonus after spending $1,000 in the first three months.However, this card has a $95 annual fee (first year is $60). Also, this card has a 5% balance transfer fee (5% for the first four months, then $5 or 5%, whichever is greater), and a 3% foreign transaction fee.The Capital One Spark Cash Plus gives you a $500 cash bonus for spending $5,000 in the first three months and you earn 2% cash back on all purchases. It also offers a 0% introductory APR on balance transfers and purchases for 15 months and a $200 signup bonus after spending $5,000 in the first three months.The only downside of this card is the $95 annual fee (waived for the first year).I've used this card for over 10 years and I love it.The American Express Blue Cash Preferred offers 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets, up to $6,000 spent per year (then 1%). Plus, you'll get 3% cash back at U.S. gas stations and select U.S. department stores, and 1% back on all other purchases.On top of that, you'll get a $200 signup bonus after spending $1,000 in the first three months, plus a 0% introductory APR on balance transfers and purchases for 15 months (then 14.49% - 23.49%).The only downside is that there's a $95 annual fee (waived for the first year).The PenFed Premium Travel Rewards American Express offers 3x points on gas for the first $6,000 spent per year and then 1x, 2x points on dining and all other purchases.Plus, you'll get 5x points on eligible travel purchases through March 2018 and a 50,000 points signup bonus after spending $4,000 in the first three months.This card has no annual fee (first year is $45), and a 0% introductory APR on balance transfers and purchases for 18 months (then 15.24% - 25.24%).However, it does have a 2.7% foreign transaction fee.The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card gives you a 50,000 points signup bonus after spending $4,000 in the first three months and offers 2x points on travel and dining.Plus, you'll get 1x points on all other purchases and a 0% introductory APR on balance transfers and purchases for 12 months (then 17.24% - 25.24%).However, this card has a $95 annual fee (waived for the first year) and a 3% foreign transaction fee.Which card do you think is the best of 2016? Let me know in the comments below!Which Credit Card Offers the Best Combination of Perks, Low Interest Rates, and Overall Financial Flexibility?11 Ways to Make Money on the Side (Some You Might Not Have Heard About Yet)The 10 Best Personal Finance Books to Read Before You Turn 30This was my second choice... But I can see how the Capital One Spark Plus was the better card in this situation. Thanks for sharing, very helpful for anyone in the market.I agree with you on the best cards, and if I was in the market, I would be getting the Capital One Spark Cash Plus. I have been looking at a Capital One Spark Cash Plus card as well, but I don't think it will be worth it for me. I will be looking into the American Express Blue Cash Preferred card though.I think this article is very helpful for people looking to make financial decisions for the year. There are so many good options out there that I would feel comfortable recommending anyone to take a look at this article and get some guidance.You are absolutely right. A lot of people do not know about the Capital One Spark Cash Plus. I used it and I have found it very useful.I am looking to save up for a vacation in a few years, and I do not think any of these cards would help with that. I am going to look into some credit cards that offer miles. I have heard of some travel credit cards, and I do not know what type of benefits they offer. I think that I will be able to figure out what type of card would help me the most when I can speak to someone about my financial needs.I never thought of looking at Capital One for a credit card. I think that I am going to have to check them out. I have been with Citibank for about 15 years now, but I am not really pleased with the fees that I am being charged. Thanks for sharing.Capital One is definitely the best! I haven't used any of their credit cards but from what I've read online I can't think of any other credit card that offers what they offer. I will definitely check them out. Thanks for the post!Woah, that's a lot of cards. I think I'll get the one from Capital One. I'm planning to save up for traveling, and it sounds like that one would help me with that.I think you missed the Chase Sapphire Reserve. It offers a 100,000 points bonus and has a $300 travel credit.I've had all 3 for about a year now. The Capital One has been amazing. The Chase Sapphire Preferred offers the best rewards, but the Capital One offers a 0% intro APR on balance transfers and purchases for the first 12 months. You get an amazing cash bonus too (up to $500).I'm curious about the PenFed. Do you have to be an active military member to sign up for it?Most banks will not let you apply for a credit card if you don't have a current checking account with them, but Capital One is different. You can apply online. You have to be at least 18 to open an account, but the credit limit is $300 with no annual fee. It's not much, but it's better than nothing. I've had it for 6 months now.I'm not going to lie, I haven't heard of these credit cards before. I would have to say Capital One Spark Cash Plus sounds like the one for me. The cash bonus after spending $5,000 in the first three months sounds like it could be a great bonus. If I were to be approved for the card, I could make the most out of the card. Thanks for this great info!Capital One Spark Cash Plus sounds really great, I would love to see what else they have to offer in the near future. I will probably sign up for the card soon.The Capital One Spark Cash Plus sounds like a great credit card for me. It will help me get to my goal of 10,000 miles.I will definitely be looking into the Capital One Spark Cash Plus card. My wife and I are looking for a new card that will help us save money on our bills. It is so nice to read this post to get some more information about credit cards. We have been wanting to find a new card for awhile, but did not know where to start. I think that I will need to start with a card that does not have a fee. It is nice that there are some great cards available. I will be looking into this card. Thank you for sharing!</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. If you're like most Americans, you probably aren't using the right card, as you'll probably find out with the results of our poll.Which credit card is the best?online surveyAirline/hotel pointsWhen it comes to credit cards, there's no one size fits all approach. Each person has his or her own needs, goals, and situation.Some people love to fly and earn airline miles as often as possible. These folks will prefer a card that offers a great sign-up bonus and/or a low-interest rate. This gives them the financial means to spend, and more money to travel, and they'll often pay for flights with the card's airline-specific miles.Other people like the flexibility and safety of having a cash-back card that will help them save money and earn rewards. The beauty of this card is that it can be used for everyday spending. If the customer chooses, it can also be used to pay for airline tickets, hotels, car rentals, and even vacation packages. This is ideal for those who like to save money and don't want to limit their spending to one particular type of trip.Another reason cash-back cards are a better option than airline miles is that they can be used anywhere, whereas airline miles are typically only good for one airline. This can limit a customer's options and make spending more expensive. For instance, if you're in the middle of the country and you want to get to a specific airport to go somewhere else, you could end up having to take two flights, using miles for both, and thus spending more money.A cash-back card can be used anywhere and will often offer a better rate, too, than miles cards. This is an added bonus for customers who love to travel but don't want to limit themselves to one airline or hotel.For those who are interested in earning points and rewards, a co-branded credit card is an ideal choice. These cards are often made through an affiliation with a major airline or hotel brand and will offer perks like priority check-in, upgrades, free hotel nights, etc. Many of these cards will also offer sign-up bonuses and low-interest rates.However, co-branded cards usually have annual fees and restrict their usage. In addition, customers who use them for travel will typically need to have a co-branded card, so this option won't be for everyone. It's important to consider your goals and needs before deciding on a credit card, as a co-branded card may not be the best option for you.No matter what card you choose, it's important to use your card responsibly. You should only use it for purchases that you're going to make, and you shouldn't take on too much debt.

What's your financial situation like? Do you pay off your credit card bill each month? Do you make a lot of large purchases each year? What are your travel and dining spending habits? These are all things to consider when making a decision.For me, I enjoy the flexibility the Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite Mastercard offers. I also appreciate the rewards I earn. Plus, it's rare to find a card with no annual fee and a low rate of 0% APR for 15 months (then 16.24%-25.24% APR). The card's $80 annual fee after the first year can be easily recouped through rewards. For example, a $1,000 in-store purchase would earn you $760 in rewards, which is enough to offset the fee.What do you prefer, and why?</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.That's a tough question to answer as credit card products change, and not everyone has the same financial situation. That said, I do have my own favorite credit card to use. My answer is the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card.This is a general travel rewards card that you can use for any purchases. It's especially great for travel purchases, as you earn bonus rewards that can be redeemed for flights. You earn three points per dollar spent on travel and dining, and one point per dollar spent on all other purchases.If you use the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, you have a few different options for redeeming your rewards. The best way is to use them through the Chase Ultimate Rewards website to book flights through United or Hyatt.There is also an option to use them to book travel through Expedia or through the airline directly. You can also use your points to shop at Amazon.com. If you want to pay for travel purchases directly with your points, you'll only get one point per dollar spent, as it is capped at 100,000 points per year.If you're looking for a card with higher travel rewards, the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card might be a better option. It comes with a $450 annual fee but offers more perks, including airport lounge access and up to $300 in statement credits per year for travel and dining purchases.The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card also has a higher rewards rate: You earn three points per dollar spent on travel and dining, and you can redeem those points for travel through the Chase Ultimate Rewards website at a 50% bonus, which equates to five points per dollar spent.The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card has a $95 annual fee, which is waived for the first year. It offers a generous introductory bonus of 60,000 points if you spend $4,000 within the first three months of opening the account. You can redeem those points for $750 in travel or $550 in cash back.The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is a good option for those who don't want to commit to a higher annual fee and still want to earn rewards that can be redeemed for travel.What Credit Card Do You Believe Offers the Best Combination of Perks, Low Interest Rates, and Overall Financial Flexibility?Do you have a favorite credit card to use? Please share your thoughts in the comments below.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I've been using the Chase Sapphire Preferred for almost a year, and I love it. Here's why:The Chase Sapphire Preferred's $450 annual fee is waived the first year (which is a major plus, given that the card earns an effective 2.1% cash back, based on my $1,200-per-year spend).Because the card earns \"points\" rather than cash back, you have an unlimited number of options for redeeming them for travel, shopping, dining, etc. For example, you can redeem your points at 1.25 cents apiece to offset a hotel stay or other travel-related expense. This isn't always the best option, but it's good to have flexibility.The card's \"travel protections\" include reimbursement for your luggage and even a few free checked bags.The Chase Sapphire Preferred comes with several perks. For example, it includes no foreign transaction fees, meaning you won't be charged for spending abroad.Finally, the Chase Sapphire Preferred also offers 2 points for every dollar you spend on dining and travel. This is a great incentive for a \"big spender,\" since you'll earn 4x on travel spending.In sum, the Chase Sapphire Preferred is an excellent card. The only drawback I've experienced is that it's a bit harder to earn the points if you have a high spend compared to the American Express Preferred, but I think that's a small sacrifice in light of all the perks the Sapphire offers.I'm curious to know what other readers think -- which card do you think is the best?More: Credit Cards Credit Card Debt InvestingMy Favorite Credit CardI'm curious to know which credit card you believe...</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. How do the current options stack up against one another?I don't like the $20,000 spending limit. I don't like the low interest rate of 1.25%. I would like to use my credit card for cashback, but I don't see that as an option. I can't get rewards points that I can use for gift cards or airline miles, nor can I get a concierge. So I think my next choice would be an Amex Blue Cash Preferred.I would probably pick Capital One Quicksilver cashback with no balance transfer fee (so I can use it if needed) and no annual fee.I'd choose the Citi Simplicity. No fees, no balance transfer fees, no annual fee.If you use your credit card wisely you shouldn't have a problem paying off your balance each month.For a good cashback credit card with no foreign transaction fees, no balance transfer fees, and no annual fee, I would recommend the Amex Blue Cash Preferred. It offers a 6% cashback for up to $6000 at grocery stores, no annual fee, no foreign transaction fees, no balance transfer fees, and a 12 month 0% introductory APR.I agree with what someone else has said. The Amex Blue Cash Preferred card is my favorite.I don't know about all of the others, but the Amex Blue Cash Preferred card has no foreign transaction fees, no annual fee, no balance transfer fees, and a 12 month 0% introductory APR.I think the Chase Freedom card would be a great choice, although if you need the card to have travel rewards then perhaps you might want to look elsewhere.I would take the Amex Blue Cash Preferred. I know there is a $20,000 spending limit. But, that means that I would have to spend $2500 a month. I would take the Quicksilver with no annual fee and no balance transfer fees.I think the Quicksilver card would be a better choice than the Amex. But, I don't know if you would like the $20,000 spending limit on the Amex.Amex is a great credit card company with many different types of credit cards.If you don't travel a lot, the Capital One Quicksilver would be the best choice. No annual fees, no balance transfer fees, and no foreign transaction fees.It's always a good idea to have at least one credit card that doesn't have an annual fee. I think it's good to have both a Visa and a MasterCard too.I think that Capital One has a really great cashback rewards program.I think the Amex Blue Cash Preferred card is the best. It doesn't charge an annual fee, there are no balance transfer fees, and it comes with 12 month 0% introductory APR.The Amex Blue Cash Preferred is the best. It's cashback rewards are great, and you get to spend $20,000 before you need to redeem rewards. The introductory rate is also pretty good, and there are no balance transfer fees.I don't think any of the ones that you listed are really that good. I don't like the high spending limit on the Amex Blue Cash Preferred, I don't like the low interest rate of 1.25%, and I don't like the Amex Blue Cash Preferred cashback rewards program. I think you would probably be better off with a regular American Express card with no cashback rewards program.I think that the Amex Blue Cash Preferred would be the best choice for a person who is looking to get the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I don't know if this will help you or not, but I would go with the Amex Blue Cash Preferred.</s>",

I have no interest in joining the credit card churning craze (though I do pay my balances in full each month), but I would like to own a solid credit card that can be used on all occasions for a variety of purposes. I'm not too concerned with cash back, rewards, or bonuses. I'm simply searching for a credit card that provides me with low interest rates and some protection against fraudulent activity.My current situation includes the following:- Approximately $40k in student loan debt- Approximately $50k in credit card debt- Approximately $20k in a savings account- No other major debtsThe credit card companies are all competing for my business. Therefore, I would like to know what you, the readers, think is the best option.

I do have about 30k in home equity that I could tap into, but I have heard that this isn't a good idea.I'd like to pay off the credit card debt as well as a personal loan. If I have any extra cash flow I'd like to add to that. The personal loan I took out was for $4k and it has a 6% interest rate, and is the only one I can pay off immediately (it is interest only).The credit card debt ranges from 21% to 13% interest rate. The highest interest rate I have is with Capital One, which is at 21.74%. I'm not sure if that is a penalty APR or not.I'm not sure what type of options are available to me. I have a friend who has done a home equity line of credit to consolidate debt and that was successful for him.I've been searching online and I've heard of a lot of companies.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I have one that I've been using for several years that's perfect for me (because it has some of those perks) but I'm still curious.I'm in my 20s, in graduate school, and looking to put as little money towards student loans as possible. I've got $10k on my credit card with no interest right now.My current card gives 1 point per $1 spent on my dining purchases, 2 points per $1 spent on gas, 3 points per $1 spent at the grocery store, and 1 point per $1 spent on everything else. I also have a reward card for dining, entertainment, and groceries which gives me 3 points per $1 spent on those purchases. I would like to put my card to better use, though, and would like to hear your suggestions.Based on this information, here's what I recommend:Cash back is the only way to go1) You currently get 1 point per $1 spent on gas. That means you'll only get 1% cash back on those purchases. The only other card that I know of that offers more points for gas purchases is the Discover it Card, which gives you 5% cash back on gas purchases, but that card has a higher interest rate (12.24% APR) than the Capital One card.2) Since you currently get 2 points per $1 spent on dining purchases and 3 points per $1 spent on grocery store purchases, those categories are probably your two highest priority categories in terms of getting the most cash back.Based on this information, I recommend that you get a cash-back credit card that is designed to give you the most points possible on the categories that you spend the most money on. You can find cash-back cards that give 5% cash back on gas purchases and 3% cash back on dining and grocery purchases. This includes the Chase Freedom card and the Capital One Venture card.You may be tempted to switch to the Chase Freedom card if it offers more points on your top two spending categories (dining and grocery). However, there's a good chance that your current card will have a lower interest rate than the Chase Freedom card (15.24% APR vs. 12.24% APR) because the Chase Freedom card also has a $50 annual fee. In this case, the Chase Freedom card may not be the best choice for you.The other card that you may be tempted to switch to is the Chase Freedom Unlimited card, which offers 3% cash back on dining, travel, and drugstore purchases and 5% cash back on Lyft rides. But this card also has an annual fee ($95) and no introductory APR. The Chase Freedom Unlimited card is a better choice for someone who makes a lot of travel and Lyft purchases, but not for you.Here's an article that compares these two cards:Should I apply for the Chase Freedom or the Chase Freedom Unlimited?You may also be interested in checking out this article to see how these two cards compare to the Capital One Venture card (which does not have an annual fee):What are some good credit cards for gas and grocery purchases?Should I get a credit card that offers a rewards program?Based on what you've said about your top priorities, you may be interested in getting a credit card that offers a rewards program, in addition to a cash-back program.The two best credit cards for rewards are the Chase Sapphire Preferred card and the Capital One Venture Rewards card. The Chase Sapphire Preferred card offers 2X rewards on travel purchases and dining purchases. The Capital One Venture Rewards card offers 2X rewards on all purchases, with no cap on how much you can earn in rewards each year.But if you're interested in getting a credit card with a lower interest rate, I recommend that you get the Capital One Venture Rewards card instead of the Chase Sapphire Preferred card because it has a lower interest rate.The other reason I recommend the Capital One Venture Rewards card is that it has a $0 annual fee and offers an introductory APR of 0% for 12 months on purchases and 0% for 12 months on balance transfers (after which the standard variable APR of 12.99% - 22.99% applies). The Chase Sapphire Preferred card does not have an introductory APR offer.You can also find more information about these two cards here:Capital One Venture Rewards vs. Chase Sapphire PreferredHow does a rewards credit card work?Should I get a card with a lower interest rate?I recommend that you apply for the Capital One Venture Rewards card because it has a lower interest rate. However, if you're already getting a lower interest rate on your current card, I don't think you need to switch. You can always apply for another card later if your current card's interest rate goes up.If you want to get a card with a lower interest rate now, you can always check out this article to see what other cards you might be able to qualify for:Should I apply for a new credit card?The Capital One Venture Rewards card is a great choice for you because it has a low interest rate and it offers a cash-back program and a rewards program.

My current card gives 1 point per $1 spent on my dining purchases, 2 points per $1 spent on gas, 3 points per $1 spent at the grocery store, and 1 point per $1 spent on everything else. I also have a reward card for dining, entertainment, and groceries which gives me 3 points per $1 spent on those purchases. I would like to put my card to better use, though, and would like to hear your suggestions.Based on this information, here's what I recommend: Cash back is the only way to go 1) You currently get 1 point per $1 spent on gas. That means you'll only get 1% cash back on those purchases. The only other card that I know of that offers more points for gas purchases is the Discover it Card, which gives you 5% cash back on gas purchases, but that card has a higher interest rate (12.24% APR) than the Capital One card. 2) Since you currently get 2 points per $1 spent on dining purchases and 3 points per $1 spent on grocery store purchases, those categories are probably your two highest priority categories in terms of getting the most cash back. Based on this information, I recommend that you get a cash-back credit card that is designed to give you the most points possible on the categories that you spend the most money on. You can find cash-back cards that give 5% cash back on gas purchases and 3% cash back on dining and grocery purchases. This includes the Chase Freedom card and the Capital One Venture card. You may be tempted to switch to the Chase Freedom card if it offers more points on your top two spending categories (dining and grocery). However, there's a good chance that your current card will have a lower interest rate than the Chase Freedom card (15.24% APR vs. 12.24% APR) because the Chase Freedom card also has a $50 annual fee. In this case, the Chase Freedom card may not be the best choice for you. The other card that you may be tempted to switch to is the Chase Freedom Unlimited card, which offers 3% cash back on dining, travel, and drugstore purchases and 5% cash back on Lyft rides. But this card also has an annual fee ($95) and no introductory APR. The Chase Freedom Unlimited card is a better choice for someone who makes a lot of travel and Lyft purchases, but not for you. Here's an article that compares these two cards: Should I apply for the Chase Freedom or the Chase Freedom Unlimited? You may also be interested in checking out this article to see how these two cards compare to the Capital One Venture card (which does not have an annual fee): What are some good credit cards for gas and grocery purchases? Should I get a credit card that offers a rewards program? Based on what you've said about your top priorities, you may be interested in getting a credit card that offers a rewards program, in addition to a cash-back program. The two best credit cards for rewards are the Chase Sapphire Preferred card and the Capital One Venture Rewards card. The Chase Sapphire Preferred card offers 2X rewards on travel purchases and dining purchases. The Capital One Venture Rewards card offers 2X rewards on all purchases, with no cap on how much you can earn in rewards each year. But if you're interested in getting a credit card with a lower interest rate, I recommend that you get the Capital One Venture Rewards card instead of the Chase Sapphire Preferred card because it has a lower interest rate. The other reason I recommend the Capital One Venture Rewards card is that it has a $0 annual fee and offers an introductory APR of 0% for 12 months on purchases and 0% for 12 months on balance transfers (after which the standard variable APR of 12.99% - 22.99% applies). The Chase Sapphire Preferred card does not have an introductory APR offer.

Should I get a card with a lower interest rate? I recommend that you apply for the Capital One Venture Rewards card because it has a lower interest rate. However, if you're already getting a lower interest rate on your current card, I don't think you need to switch. You can always apply for another card later if your current card's interest rate goes up.

Which of the following credit cards would you recommend?I don't see why this question is not being closed as a poll.I am trying to get the 200000 point for free.I'd suggest the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. No annual fee, 1.25% cash back on everything, 50,000 bonus points for signing up (worth $500 in cash), plus some other great perks.I agree with the above recommendation. I am also a big fan of the Citi Double Cash card for simplicity.I agree with @Todd_B, but there are a number of great cards with no annual fee (such as the Barclaycard Arrival Plus, which gives 2% back on everything, and has no annual fee), so there is a wide range of options if you don't mind having an annual fee.My wife and I both have the Citi Double Cash.
