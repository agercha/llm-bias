        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.In the last few months I have had to use both my AMEX Green and Chase Sapphire Preferred credit cards quite a bit. I'm not sure I like the amount of money I've spent. What I like, however, is the flexibility they offer me. The perks and free travel make the high interest rate on the AMEX Green card more than worth it. I'm currently in Europe and have a good amount of money on my Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card that I will not be able to use until I return to the United States. I know that I have a high interest rate on this credit card, but I can pay it back without penalty if I want to. This type of flexibility makes this credit card great in my book.I don't know which credit card is better for you, but I'm hoping that I can find out from your answers. Let me know which credit card you use and how it works for you in the comments section below.Do you carry multiple credit cards?</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I want to make the most out of my financial assets in the coming year. I have a lot of debt, but I have the ability to get rid of a lot of it. I am looking at several different options including Discover, Chase, and a couple other options. It would be nice to get a card with good bonuses to help me cover some of my bills. I've heard a lot about Discover. It offers good bonuses and a reasonable interest rate, but I don't know about their customer service. I'm hoping to get a card that is affordable to use. Thanks for the information.Re: Help Me Find the Best Credit Cardby Kwisatz \u00bb Thu Jan 24, 2013 3:35 amIf you want low interest rate you will need to get a secured card. I'd recommend a secured Chase card.by khaled2110 \u00bb Thu Jan 24, 2013 5:10 amI don't know why you're looking for so many things in one credit card. Just pick the one that is going to best fit your needs. If you're looking for the lowest interest rate, then I agree with Kwisatz - get a secured card from Chase. It's not only a good secured card, but it also rewards you as you get your finances together and pay off the card.by jerseygirl \u00bb Thu Jan 24, 2013 10:56 amkhaled2110 wrote: I don't know why you're looking for so many things in one credit card.

It sounds to me like a credit card is not what you need. If you could pay off all your credit cards, it would be the better choice, as you don't have to worry about being hit by a big interest payment at the end of the month. You can put some of the money you get from your bonuses towards paying down your debt. It will go a lot further and you won't have to worry about the interest.by Caitlin \u00bb Fri Jan 25, 2013 3:55 pmI'd just go with whatever bank you already use for checking and savings, unless you have a specific need for a particular benefit or service that another credit card issuer might have.</s>",

In a situation like that, the only thing that you can do is apply for a card, charge up as much as you can, pay the minimum balance due, and hope that you can work your way out of debt.It's a dangerous financial strategy, and you don't want to do that. You have a lot of credit available to you. Don't let it go to waste. If you're going to get a new credit card, you should take advantage of it and find a credit card that will reward you for using it.I'm going to recommend a few cards that you may want to consider.I'm not going to recommend a credit card that offers a 0% APR introductory rate. That's a nice benefit to have, but that's not the kind of credit card I would recommend for someone with bad credit. I don't recommend cards that have high interest rates.Here are a few that I'd like to share with you:I'd like to recommend the Chase Freedom. It's a decent credit card, and it's got a low APR. The interest rate is just 14.99%, but I don't like the fact that you have to pay it off in full in 20 months.This is a good card to consider if you're going to be able to use it responsibly.Another good card to consider is the BankAmericard Cash Rewards. It's a great card to use to earn cash back rewards. It's got a decent interest rate and a $0 annual fee.The BankAmericard Cash Rewards is one of the best credit cards for bad credit. You can use it to build your credit, and the interest rate is relatively low.Another card to consider is the Capital One Quicksilver. It's a good card to use to earn travel rewards. It has a 15.99% interest rate, and it has a $0 annual fee.These cards are all great options for someone with a bad credit score.You said that you're planning on getting a mortgage, so I'd like to recommend a mortgage lender that I've had good luck with:The last thing I want to mention is a free financial adviser:I hope you found these recommendations useful.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.To me it seems that there are four distinct credit cards that offer these benefits:Discover it (Chase Sapphire Preferred)US Bank (Citi Double Cash)Discover it (Chase Freedom Unlimited)Amazon Prime (Chase Amazon Rewards)I'm looking for an authoritative opinion on which of these cards is the best one for everyday spending, but which offers the best return on major purchases (especially international travel, as that's what I'd be using it for most frequently.)So, for example, if Discover It (Chase Sapphire Preferred) offers the best combination of points and perks, but if you wanted to put 20k on it in one shot it would cost you 2%, then would that be worth it?EDIT: As of now, I've got my Discover It (Chase Sapphire Preferred), my US Bank (Citi Double Cash), my Amex EveryDay, and my Discover it (Chase Freedom Unlimited) cards. The Freedom Unlimited offers the best return per $ spent, but I'm wondering if the cashback is worth sacrificing the other benefits and points for some major purchases, like say a plane ticket to Europe.I'm also wondering if the Chase Amazon Rewards is a decent one to keep since it's just so easy to earn points from shopping at Amazon.credit-card rewards cash-backAsked another way, is there any real point to having multiple credit cards that all offer roughly the same benefits? The Chase cards have pretty similar benefits, as do the Amex ones. I have a few different cards, but I'm wondering if there's any major benefit to having more than a couple. \u2013 Andrew Russell Mar 2 '17 at 18:51In most cases, no. However, sometimes having multiple cards can help to maximize your rewards. \u2013 Michael Lai\u2666 Mar 2 '17 at 18:53Is there any difference between Discover and Discover it in regards to rewards? \u2013 Andrew Russell Mar 2 '17 at 18:55@AndrewRussell They both have a 1.5% cash back rewards program. The \"it\" refers to the fact that the card has an \"it\" in its name. The Discover card doesn't. \u2013 JoeTaxpayer\u2666 Mar 2 '17 at 19:07In some cases it may be worth paying the 5% foreign transaction fee on the Discover it Chase Sapphire Preferred card, if you don't have the US Bank Citi Double Cash. It will cost you $27 if you spend $1000 in foreign transactions on this card. \u2013 Grade 'Eh' Bowman Mar 2 '17 at 21:02I think the key thing here is to get the right one. That's the card that gives you the best value for what you want to buy.For me that means:Miles and points: Chase Sapphire PreferredTravel Rewards: Amex EveryDayRestaurant purchases: Amex EveryDayGrocery Purchases: Chase Sapphire PreferredCash Back: Chase Freedom UnlimitedNow, I'm in a little bit of an unusual situation here because I have no interest in getting travel rewards. So the Chase Sapphire Preferred is really just giving me an opportunity to earn extra points on stuff I would normally buy anyway. The only things I buy with the Amex card are groceries (which I buy every week) and a bit of travel. And, while I do eat at restaurants, I don't use my Amex card there. (I have a Capital One card for that.)If you are using the points to get travel rewards, the Chase Sapphire Preferred might not be as valuable.I have the Sapphire Preferred and I do use it for travel - I just book through a travel agent and then use the points to offset the cost. It seems like I use my Chase Sapphire Preferred about twice a year to book travel - that being said, I have never booked travel through the Chase Ultimate Rewards site. \u2013 Nate Mar 2 '17 at 21:30The Sapphire Preferred is great for travel in general. You can just book hotel stays and use the points. Or you can book travel through Chase's portal and use the points for anything. \u2013 JoeTaxpayer\u2666 Mar 3 '17 at 17:48Yes. You can use your points for anything. There is no restriction on what you use them for. It is simply easier to get the \"best value\" if you book travel. (Or you can use the points for merchandise and gift cards, but there is no point in doing that because you can simply use the points to pay for that merchandise and get a 10% discount.) \u2013 JoeTaxpayer\u2666 Mar 3 '17 at 17:52The Discover it Chase Sapphire Preferred is the best for most situations, and there is no significant difference in the benefits between the two.I personally have the Discover it Chase Sapphire Preferred. I have used it a handful of times for large purchases and had no problem getting the bonus at $5,000.Discover has had some very attractive signup bonuses on a couple of occasions, but the current one is too low for me. However, if you are able to use the card and get the 5x points per dollar in rotating categories, it is very nice. In fact, I've earned 25k+ points in just a few months of use. That's enough for 3-5 flights around the world (assuming you don't take a long trip).The Chase Freedom Unlimited is great for everyday spending, and the 1.5% cash back is not bad, especially if you don't have other 1.5% cards. I have it because I had the card that was discontinued, but I am considering downgrading.The US Bank Citi Double Cash and Amex Everyday are both great cards as well. I am looking at the US Bank Citi Double Cash for a few reasons:Earn 2x on everything (but no bonus category)15 month 0% introductory APR on purchases (after that, the APR is 14.99% - 24.99%)Flat 2% cash back on all purchasesThe US Bank Citi Double Cash is the only card that offers a 0% APR, which is really nice for someone who wants to put down a large amount and keep interest to a minimum.The Amex Everyday offers 2x points for purchases in the US at U.S. restaurants, on U.S. purchases at U.S. gas stations and U.S. supermarkets. This is also the only one that offers 10% bonus points on everyday purchases, so you get 20x points per dollar spent in those categories.The Amex Everyday does not offer any intro APRs, but it does not offer the 15 month 0% intro APR like the US Bank Citi Double Cash.The Chase Amazon Rewards offers 2% cash back, but the \"cash back\" is in the form of redeemable Amazon.com gift cards. I use the Amazon Rewards primarily for my Amazon purchases. But I have used it for other purchases where I know I will receive a lot of reward points back (such as Amazon gift cards). If you only use it to buy Amazon items, then I don't think the 2% cash back is bad at all.I am in a situation similar to you, and it is best for you to use the card that gives you the best value for what you are buying. I know that is the Sapphire Preferred, but you should decide what gives you the best value.You also have to weigh in your spending habits and your future spending. I find that the Freedom Unlimited is good for most of my spending.I find it easier to earn rewards by using the Discover it Chase Sapphire Preferred, and when I travel, I use the Discover it Chase Sapphire Preferred.I like having my Discover it Chase Sapphire Preferred, but I am considering downgrading it to the Freedom Unlimited.Andrew RussellAndrew RussellIf you use your Amex EveryDay at restaurants, that will cost you 2% (2x points = 1 point, since 1 point = 1 cent for every dollar spent). \u2013 JoeTaxpayer\u2666 Mar 2 '17 at 19:09Thanks. I updated the answer to reflect the 2x points = 1 point. I guess I was overthinking it :) \u2013 Andrew Russell Mar 2 '17 at 19:11Not the answer you're looking for?

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I'd love to hear your personal opinions on this topic.Whenever I'm given a choice between paying by cash or by credit, I always opt to use my credit card, even when I don't have to pay a dime on it. This is because I am not paying the bill in full every month, and the interest rate on my credit card is actually much lower than my savings account.So what kind of card would you use?Would you use a travel rewards card that lets you cash in for free flights or hotel stays?Would you choose a rewards card that gives you a certain percentage back on every purchase you make?Would you choose a card that's a combination of both, offering a certain percentage cash back and the ability to redeem rewards for free flights or hotel stays?Or would you choose a low interest rate card that doesn't offer many perks?How do you select the right card for your needs?In my opinion, the best credit card to have is a low interest rate card. That way, if I decide to go on a shopping spree, and I can't pay the balance in full that month, I know I won't be penalized with a sky high interest rate on my card. But, I would also like to earn a little extra cash back here and there.I like a travel rewards credit card, but one that does not have an annual fee attached. I do not like to pay for rewards I earn. I want my rewards to come free of charge!For me, a low interest card is the perfect combination of a low interest rate and the ability to earn cash back and rewards.A low interest rate card is very important to me. I do not have a lot of debt, and I always pay my bill in full, so I do not worry about interest too much. But, I also would not want to be limited to only certain rewards and cash back offers.I think a low interest rate card is the best option for me. But, I also like that there are travel rewards cards out there, so that if I do decide to travel, I can get a percentage of my money back.I like a rewards card, but I am also concerned about interest rates. If I was given the option of paying an annual fee for cash back, I would rather pay that fee than have a low interest rate that ends up costing me a lot in the long run.I prefer the low interest rate card, but I also would like the option of cash back.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. What would you consider the best credit card for frequent travelers? And the best for students? And the best for people with bad credit? For everyday purchases?I'll be honest with you, I don't have the best track record when it comes to credit cards.I've had at least three credit cards over the past decade, and I've had an on-and-off love-hate relationship with each one. I've accumulated about $5000 in credit card debt over the years, which is no small feat for a person who once had credit score in the high 800s.I was so obsessed with my credit score for so long, it became an obsession that eventually ruined my financial well-being. It became all-consuming, and ultimately, all-consumed. I found myself spending $1200 on a pair of shoes I couldn't afford, and I justified my purchases to myself, by telling myself I was doing it for my credit score. I would tell myself, \"This is good for my credit score, because I'm building my credit score and I can use it later in life to take advantage of things like low interest rates and free flights.\"It took me a long time to recover financially from that debt, and I still have bad memories of it.In the years that followed my worst financial mistake, I learned that most credit cards are like relationships. They're not always good, they're not always bad. They can be great at some times, and horrible at others. Sometimes, they're worth every penny of the money you're paying for them. Other times, they're terrible. You have to make a judgement call about which cards are right for you at which points in your financial life. You can't always choose the right card, and you can't always avoid the wrong card, but you can be smart about how you use them and how you choose them.I've learned some good lessons in my years of credit card usage, and I've come to a few conclusions. Here's what I would tell you, if I were your best friend.1) If you're in debt and have credit card debt, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to fix a bad situation and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.I don't recommend paying off your credit card debt with a credit card. You'll be back in debt in no time if you use that same card, but that's not the goal. I recommend paying it off with money you've saved, money you've earned through a side-hustle, or money from a loan you've taken out. You can't get that money with a credit card. You can't get it with a debit card, either. You can only get it with money.2) If you're looking to build credit, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just looking to build your credit, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.3) If you're looking for rewards, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just looking for rewards, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.4) If you're trying to improve your financial situation, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to improve your financial situation, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.5) If you're looking for cashback, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just looking for cashback, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.6) If you're looking to pay off your student loan debt, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to pay off your student loan debt, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.7) If you're looking to pay off your car loan, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to pay off your car loan, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.8) If you're looking to pay off your mortgage, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to pay off your mortgage, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.9) If you're looking to pay off your credit card debt, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to pay off your credit card debt, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.10) If you're looking to pay off your credit card debt, it doesn't mean you're bad with credit. You're not bad with credit. You're just trying to pay off your credit card debt, and you're trying to find the right card for you to use.I hope that list helps you understand that I'm not trying to shame people into not using credit cards. I'm trying to tell you how to use credit cards, and how to pick the right cards for you.</s>",
