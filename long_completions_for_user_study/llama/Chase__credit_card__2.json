You may want to click on the individual cards in order to learn more about the rewards, interest rates, annual fees, and other details.I'm using Discover It as my go-to card. I do have the Chase Sapphire Preferred for emergency use and have had the American Express Green (premier) card for a long time.I also have the Chase Freedom Unlimited for all my daily purchases, and a Discover it for rotating categories, and a Blue Cash from American Express for groceries. But I never carry a balance on any of them, and I pay all my balances in full every month, so why have all these credit cards? Because every card has different benefits and the Discover is currently giving me the best overall rewards.While Chase Sapphire Preferred provides the best travel benefits for those who use the card to book hotels and travel, Chase Ink Bold is great if you spend a lot on travel or on things like cell phone bills. It\u2019s one of the few cards to offer 5x on phone bills.I have the AMEX Platinum card and it is a very good card. I don't use it much except for big purchases that I can pay off quickly. They just raised the annual fee to $450 and it will likely go to $550 next year. This is the only reason I am even thinking about dropping it.I use it in the U.S. and around the world. It works in most places without a problem and has the advantage of no foreign transaction fees. You are charged no foreign transaction fees on your credit cards.I just had to drop the AMEX SPG card (for the same reasons). In 2019 it will no longer be useful for me. So I will be looking to find a new credit card.The first card I ever received was a bank credit card when I was 19, so I have had a card for 18 years. I have had many different cards but my go-to card is a Chase Sapphire Preferred. I have a high credit limit and an excellent credit score, so this is the card I use almost every day. I pay it off each month to avoid any interest charges, and I can use the card anywhere Visa is accepted, which covers a lot of stores.It's been 15 years since my first credit card. My current one is the Chase Sapphire Reserve which offers a great travel benefit but is a bit expensive for me.I got the Chase Sapphire Preferred as my go-to card, even though I rarely use it. I travel for work and business and have two airline cards, but Chase Sapphire Preferred is my backup when I can't use the other two. I have an excellent credit score so I am not worried about the annual fee.I have been a Chase Sapphire Preferred user for many years. It\u2019s a great card. I use it every day and reap the rewards of the excellent travel benefits. I don\u2019t carry a balance. If I did, it would be more expensive than any of the others I use.My card is the Capital One Venture Rewards card. My primary card is the Chase Freedom Unlimited, but I like the Capital One card better for several reasons:- The cash back is unlimited instead of the $1,500 cap with Freedom Unlimited.- It also comes with 20,000 miles as a bonus.- It is a no annual fee card.I have the Capital One Venture card, as well as Chase Sapphire Preferred. The Capital One card gets all of my travel expenses, and the Chase is my secondary. I also have the Chase Freedom Unlimited, which gets all of my everyday spending.I have a Capital One Venture card and I use it for most of my expenses. The only places I don't use it are for hotels and air travel. I get 2% back on all of my expenses, which can be used for free travel anywhere.

Although I have a very good credit score, I find the $450 annual fee steep, and the 5x points on travel are worthless to me as I book all my own travel, and have never been loyal to one airline or hotel. I will be dropping the card this year in favor of a card that gives me rewards on travel, without the annual fee.I have been carrying a Citi Diamond Preferred card for years because I like the low interest rate and the rewards on everyday expenses. I also have a few other credit cards.I have used Chase Sapphire Preferred for many years. It is not my go-to card because it has a higher annual fee, but I have found that it is a good card to have for the rewards. The interest rate is not the best and it is not a cash back card, but it has a 25% bonus for travel. I also have other cards that provide more benefits and rewards.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card has been my go-to credit card for many years.

I have the AMEX Platinum card too, but use it only when I need to purchase an airline ticket or a hotel room.I use the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards card and the Discover It card as my primary cards for travel and everyday use. I also have the Capital One Venture Rewards card. I like the Venture Rewards card because it gives me the highest percentage back on all of my travel purchases. I also like the Quicksilver Cash Rewards card because I don\u2019t have to keep track of my travel purchases. I just get 1.5% back on everything I buy.I have been using the American Express Blue Cash Preferred card as my go-to card for years. I love that it gives me the biggest cash back for groceries and I also like that it gives me a 6% cash back on all my purchases. I don\u2019t use any other card for purchases.I am using the Chase Sapphire Reserve card. It gives me 3x for travel, and has the best travel benefits. I am also using the Chase Freedom Unlimited card because I have two cash back categories, which are easy to manage.The Chase Sapphire Reserve card is the best credit card for me because of the 3x travel rewards and the annual travel benefits.I currently have two primary credit cards, the Capital One Venture Rewards card and the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. Both cards have been great and I have received good rewards with each one.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I've had two credit cards in the past - the Chase Freedom card which had a few useful perks, but high interest rates (and is now a \"Slate\" card due to a missed payment). The other was the Citi AAdvantage card that had low interest, and good perks - but I still had to put off travel until my savings accumulated to a sufficient degree.Currently I use a CapitalOne card for my gas purchases and a debit card for the rest, but it seems a credit card would be much more flexible and useful, and possibly cheaper in the long run, especially with an APR of 0% or lower.In your opinion, what's the best current card on the market today?posted by gman to Travel & Transportation around San Francisco, CA (22 answers total) 14 users marked this as a favoriteI second the Barclay's JetBlue card. Great rates and generous benefits (especially in NYC, as it's based on your ZipCode, so it's the only card I need for cabs, discounts at the theater, etc.posted by lester's sock puppet at 10:43 AM on March 26, 2012 [1 favorite]I love my Chase Freedom card, as I've been able to take a 0% loan on it and pay it off with it, and the bonus miles every quarter make it a sweet deal.posted by jenfullmoon at 10:46 AM on March 26, 2012I have the Barclaycard Arrival Plus card, and I like it a lot.1) No yearly fee2) 5% bonus miles for all purchases3) No foreign transaction fee4) No minimum spend required5) 0% interest for 12 months6) 20,000 bonus miles after spending $1,000 in the first 90 daysposted by yukonho at 10:53 AM on March 26, 2012We had the Chase Freedom card, but the 14.99% interest rate was a bit more than we wanted to pay. I'm not sure what the difference is, but we recently switched to the Chase Slate card. I think the biggest difference is that they advertise 0% for 15 months rather than a set amount of time.posted by tacodave at 11:06 AM on March 26, 2012Citi's ThankYou Points Visa is my favorite because of the 3 ThankYou Points you get for every dollar on all purchases, so you can easily redeem them for travel or cash. You can also get a sign-up bonus of 40k points. And it's 0% for 15 months.But that's just what I like.posted by palliser at 11:18 AM on March 26, 2012I love mine!posted by gingerbeer at 11:28 AM on March 26, 2012Best Cash Rewards is the best of the best if you want to get cash back.You might consider opening up a Discover card and using it for gas (it earns you cash back as well).posted by 6550 at 11:37 AM on March 26, 2012CapitalOne has been running a pretty decent offer in the last few months: you get 20,000 points (worth $200 in travel) if you spend $500 in the first three months.And I second the Barclaycard Arrival Plus card. I've had it since October and I love it. The miles are awesome and the interest rate is 0% until June. I haven't done any of the other benefits yet.posted by rw at 11:39 AM on March 26, 2012Citi's ThankYou Points Visa is my favorite because of the 3 ThankYou Points you get for every dollar on all purchasesCiti just announced that they're changing to 2x on restaurants and hotels.I love my Citi ThankYou card and I'm sad they're changing the rewards. It's the only place I've found that earns ThankYou Points.If you do apply for it, use this link. It's not a signup bonus or anything.I'm pretty happy with my Chase Freedom card. It gets a high rate on travel purchases (for me), no foreign transaction fees, and a 0% interest rate on balance transfers for 18 months. It's not all that good on other purchases, but that's my only credit card so I only have to think about it once every 3 months.posted by lukemeister at 11:54 AM on March 26, 2012If it's a credit card you're after rather than a travel reward credit card, check out the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. It has great travel insurance benefits (and cancellation insurance, if you book airfare through the travel website Chase uses), as well as a 50,000 point sign-up bonus.posted by phoenixy at 12:10 PM on March 26, 2012 [1 favorite]I'm not a card-carrying fan of the Chase Freedom card but it's the one that makes the most sense to me based on the details you have shared. I'd also look at the Bank of America Travel Rewards card. I know a few people who got this card because it was 0% until August and the reward rate was 1.5X. I haven't heard much in terms of the perks on this card so YMMV.I know nothing about travel rewards cards so I wouldn't give you any advice on those.posted by kendrak at 12:36 PM on March 26, 2012I was wondering this too because my Amex has a 0% APR until June.posted by bleep at 1:10 PM on March 26, 2012I have the Chase Freedom card, which I really like. I think it is a very good value, with a low interest rate and the option of 18 months of no interest.As for what card is best, I think that question depends a lot on what you do with the card. For someone who uses it primarily for travel and other expenses that earn a lot of points/miles, there are other options with better rewards. For someone who uses it only occasionally, the Barclaycard Arrival Plus card sounds like a good deal.posted by mikeh at 2:46 PM on March 26, 2012I have the Citi Double Cash (which I got with the $200 bonus). For me it works out well because I use it for everything (gas, groceries, etc) and then just use the cash back to pay off my credit card bill.posted by hought20 at 2:47 PM on March 26, 2012Response by poster: Cool, I've added some new cards to my list of options. Thanks, guys.posted by gman at 2:49 PM on March 26, 2012I've had a Capital One card (first was the One Credit Card) and the Citi Double Cash card for awhile now and have been quite happy with both. I think Capital One gives more options to redeem points than Citi. I've used both for 2 months (and 1 year) free Hulu and have enough points to buy more.posted by kimberussell at 3:27 PM on March 26, 2012I second the Chase Freedom.I use the Chase Freedom as well as the Barclay Arrival Plus Card, and I would say they both have their pros and cons. With the Arrival Plus, I like how the points are good for whatever you want to spend them on. But I have to remember to use them. With the Chase, I don't have to remember, since I use it for everything. But the points on the Chase only work for airline travel or hotel rooms. And the Chase doesn't give me any extra benefits that the Arrival Plus does. It's a toss-up, IMO.posted by sperose at 6:59 PM on March 26, 2012I have the Citi AAdvantage Executive card and love it. I also have the Citi ThankYou points card and it was an OK card, but the rewards were not worth the trouble of changing my spending habits. Now that you are considering credit cards, I'd suggest that you look into getting a Chase Sapphire Preferred card. It's a great card for travel rewards.posted by 6550 at 8:09 PM on March 26, 2012I really like my Chase Freedom card. I think it's a great rewards card (though I haven't done the math yet to see if it's more valuable than a flat 2% cash back), especially for a no-fee card.posted by ooga_booga at 10:57 PM on March 26, 2012I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred. It's not a credit card as much as a travel rewards card. It's only good for travel (or cash-out value of the reward) rewards points and there's a $95 annual fee. But it gets me a pretty good deal on all my travel rewards and free hotel stays, so I feel it's worth it.I'm currently sitting on a $300 sign-up bonus from a credit card I used once before. My wife uses it for everything, so we just cash out the rewards. You can do it through PayPal or get a check in the mail.posted by lilywinged at 8:26 AM on March 27, 2012\u00ab Older I want to move to LA.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I personally use a Capital One credit card for my daily shopping. It allows me to accumulate cash-back rewards, which I then use to pay for my mortgage. I would like to learn more about my options and figure out what works best for me.Asked by dcsherry05 on 12/2/08 11:42amCapital One is a great credit card. I like their Venture Rewards cards best. They offer a 0% interest APR if you pay your balance in full every month and they will also match your reward point total at the end of your anniversary date.I've had the same credit card for years. It was the first one I ever had, and I still use it.I have used a credit card for over 15 years. It has always worked well for me. I can get cash from it at any ATM and the interest rates are low.There are a lot of benefits to having a credit card. However, you can go to a lot of financial distress if you don't manage your finances wisely.I currently have 4 different credit cards. They offer different perks and I use them for different things. The ones I have are Citi, Amex, Capital One and Visa. I also have a store credit card.We have a Chase Visa that has a reward system that we use for travel. The rewards are very easy to redeem and have been worthwhile for us.I've never had a credit card.There's no such thing as \"best.\" It depends on your habits, your spending patterns, etc. But you should look at the annual fees, the interest rates, and all the perks, like travel bonuses and cash back. Also, what is the company like? Do they have a good reputation? You should shop around. I personally like Visa, American Express, and Capital One.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. The best thing about the credit card world is that it's ever-changing; with each new credit card issuer, a different player tries to take the top spot.My favorite card for 2013 was the American Express Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card because of its exceptional 6% cash-back rate on all purchases at supermarkets, gas stations, and department stores. However, in this card match-up, the Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card isn't even in the running.So, if you're looking for a new card, which one should you get?Here are five credit cards I like, each for different reasons.1. Bank of America Cash Rewards\u00ae Visa\u00ae Credit Card: The Bank of America Cash Rewards\u00ae Visa\u00ae Credit Card has been around for a while, and it's been a strong competitor in the cash-back field. It has no annual fee and earns an unlimited 3% cash back on gas, 2% cash back on groceries, and 1% cash back on all other purchases. These rates are competitive with other cards on the market.However, one of the biggest strengths of this card is that Bank of America rewards its most loyal customers with the ability to earn 5% cash back at select merchants. There are 30,000 participating merchants in the program, and many of them are popular businesses, like Staples and Best Buy. But, you won't find all of your favorite brands there.On a 200-point scale, this card gets 5 stars from me. It gets 3 stars for cash back rate and 2 stars for rewards program.2. Chase Freedom\u00ae Card: If you're looking for one of the best rewards programs in the industry, look no further than the Chase Freedom\u00ae Card. With it, you'll earn 5% cash back in rotating quarterly categories, up to $1,500 in spending each quarter. These quarterly categories are announced in January, April, July, and October, and they range from groceries to travel to gas.While the rotating categories offer you an opportunity to earn 5% cash back at the places you spend the most, you may also take advantage of the $100 cash bonus you'll get each year for spending $500 in the first three months after opening your account.The card comes with no annual fee, and you'll receive a sign-up bonus of 5% cash back on your first $1,500 in purchases within three months. You can also get a 1% cash back on all other purchases. The Chase Freedom\u00ae Card gets 5 stars on the cash back rate category, 4 stars for rewards program, and 1 star for annual fee.3. Citi ThankYou\u00ae Preferred Card: If you want to travel without paying a fee to earn rewards for your purchases, the Citi ThankYou\u00ae Preferred Card is a good option. As long as you can pay your balance off in full each month, you'll get 1% cash back on purchases and 1 ThankYou point per dollar spent. However, it's important to understand that you'll get only 1 point per dollar spent if you choose not to pay your balance in full each month. You'll have to pay at least the minimum amount due by the due date or you'll lose the 1% cash-back rate and won't get 1 point per dollar spent.The ThankYou points you'll earn with the card can be used to book travel through Citi at a rate of one cent per point. That means you can save $250 on travel bookings if you've accrued 25,000 points. Alternatively, you can transfer the points to airline and hotel partners. You can save up to 20% off travel purchases when you redeem your points for travel. The card also offers a $50 statement credit for Global Entry or TSA Precheck membership and a sign-up bonus of 20,000 ThankYou points.The Citi ThankYou\u00ae Preferred Card gets 4 stars for rewards program and 2 stars for cash back rate and annual fee.4. Wells Fargo Platinum Visa\u00ae Card: The Wells Fargo Platinum Visa\u00ae Card offers one of the best cash-back rates for new cardholders in 2013. Within the first three months after opening your account, you can get 1.5% cash back on all your purchases, up to $12,500 spent. You'll also get 1.5% cash back for the rest of the year, and you'll get 1% cash back for the rest of your time with the card. There's no annual fee.Besides the cash-back rate, this card gets another 5 stars from me because it offers free FICO\u00ae credit scores on monthly statements. There are many cards that offer this feature, but you usually have to pay for it.The Wells Fargo Platinum Visa\u00ae Card gets 5 stars for cash back rate, 4 stars for annual fee, and 1 star for rewards program.5. Chase Freedom\u00ae Card with the IHG\u00ae Rewards Club Select Credit Card: One of the best perks of having this card is the ability to earn a free night with each card anniversary. You'll also get 25,000 bonus points on the first purchase you make with the card. In addition, you'll receive a 10% rebate of IHG points when you redeem them, which can be especially useful if you're trying to book a room at a high-end resort, as it may otherwise cost you many thousands of points.The card comes with a $60 annual fee, but you'll get $120 in free nights after the first anniversary. You'll also get automatic upgrade status and complimentary internet access at IHG hotels. Finally, you'll be given 40,000 IHG points after spending $1,000 in the first three months of card membership.The IHG\u00ae Rewards Club Select Credit Card gets 5 stars for cash back rate and annual fee, and 1 star for rewards program.How about you?

Let us know by commenting below or on our Facebook page.To take the challenge to another level, here's the card match-up for the best credit card of 2014!This is a difficult matchup. As of 1/14/14 the Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa does not have the cash back rates. The Platinum Visa is currently listed as 1.5% cash back for the first 6 months (then revert to 1.25% ongoing).It's still a good card because it is FREE with no annual fee.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I'm personally using the Chase Freedom Unlimited, which is similar to the Chase Sapphire Preferred card in that you can earn 3 points per dollar spent at grocery stores, up to $1,500 spent annually. If you make at least $1,500 worth of purchases at grocery stores each year, you'll also have the opportunity to earn an extra 3% on all of your grocery store purchases as well as 5% on up to $15,000 in combined purchases at select US restaurants and US drugstores.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I was looking for a card that's a bit similar to what TD has to offer (cash back, 0% intro APR, 5% reward rate) and found Capital One. They offer a card that gives 2% cash back on purchases for new card holders, and have a 0% introductory APR period of up to 20 months.You could apply for the Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card to take advantage of these benefits.I'm curious to know what your thoughts on Capital One are, if you've ever used them in the past, and what you'd recommend. I think it's a really good card, and I hope to use it in the future.How about Chase? Any of their cards, or do you prefer other financial institutions? I know there's a lot of people that really don't like Chase, but I'm curious what you think about the company.I currently have the Discover It\u00ae Miles Card, so I guess you could say I lean toward Discover.Were you able to get the 0% intro APR that Capital One offers with your other card, or was it an intro 0% APR?Capital One is fine, but not the best. They do some good things like the 2% cash back. I have a Capital One card and like it ok, but not great. I get more value from my TD card.I don't have one. I have a credit card for the emergency fund but have not used it yet. I can say for sure, Chase is better than Capital One. They were both very high on the credit card scandal list. That makes them suspicious in my book.I use Chase, but I think Chase is just as good or bad as any other. I've never had any issues with Chase and I've had many, many cards.Capital One is fine, but I would never use them if they didn't have an option to cash out and get a check in the mail. I always have to do this with Capital One and I can't stand it. I can't stand any card where it takes like a month to get a check in the mail.Chase and Wells Fargo are my favorites. Capital One is okay, but I like Discover better.I use Wells Fargo. I have the Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa card and I've been really happy with it. They offer 0% intro APR on balance transfers and have some good rewards. They don't have a sign up bonus, but I'm not really that interested in getting the perks of a sign up bonus. The interest rate is 0% APR for the first 12 months of use, which I find really good.Wells Fargo is my bank of choice. I also like Discover and American Express.I have a Discover card, and I'm very happy with it. They're one of the best cards that I've ever had, and they've got a really good offer that comes with it. They're offering a $150 statement credit if you make any purchase within the first three months.Would you recommend Discover to others?I don't have one. I don't really care what kind of credit card I use.I don't have a credit card. I don't use them because they're a pain. If I could have a credit card that had all the same features as a debit card, I would.What do you think about Discover?What are some of the things that bother you most about using a credit card?I don't have a credit card because they just give you a lot of financial stress. There's so many things that could go wrong, and so many hidden fees.I don't have a credit card because I have an aversion to credit cards. I've never had a credit card before, and I don't like them.I don't have a credit card because I don't want to take out loans and get into financial trouble.</s>",

The top three picks from users of our own CreditCards.com Poll of Best Credit Card Providers are:Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite MastercardIn each of these cases, it looks as though users preferred cards offering rewards as opposed to cash back, but I am a little surprised that more users didn't pick Chase Sapphire Preferred as the best rewards card, given its stellar rewards structure and lack of foreign transaction fees. The Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite Mastercard was only selected as the top pick in 1.3% of user votes, which may indicate that people are unfamiliar with its rewards structure.I wonder what other people think about the best cards offered by each of the above providers.

the last decade, which is why it's now so much easier for companies to offer a variety of perks for customers.Banks have become savvier about their customers' financial needs, and as a result, they're

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.But I'm not asking which credit card is best for YOU. I want to know which one offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.That is to say, which credit card best reflects the interests of most of the American public?Today's topic is the result of my frustration with my own credit cards. I've tried to be a good cardholder in the past, but with the amount of credit card marketing I see, I've started to wonder: am I being ripped off by my credit card issuer?Based on this, I'd like to offer a little experiment for the readers of Get Rich Slowly.I want to know which card you believe is the best for most people in the U.S.So, what do you say, fellow GRS readers? I challenge you to choose the best credit card (or combination of credit cards) that represents the interest of the majority of Americans.If your choice isn't currently available, what do you think would be the best offer?A few notes about the contest:I don't know that this is possible, but you may choose to answer based on an ideal card. For instance, you could state that the best credit card is a 0% card with low annual fees and no foreign transaction fees.You don't need to specify which card you're talking about, just the general concept. If you're talking about the Chase Sapphire, then be specific. If you're talking about a 0% card, then just say 0%. I won't be able to give a prize to everyone who answers, but I'd like to see people answer to the best of their abilities.I'm not sure I can get prizes, but I'd like to try to give a prize to one lucky winner. If I can't get a prize, then I'll give away something cool that I have, but nothing from a credit card issuer. If you're curious, I can offer a free copy of my book, or an autographed copy. I can even send it as an audio book, which means I could also offer a book for anyone who can't read.If I get no response, then I guess I'll simply pick the American Express card with the lowest interest rate. (I believe this is currently at 9.74%, but I may be wrong.) But I would prefer to give away something for the person who gives me the best answer.If I get 100 responses, I'll choose one winner. If I get less than 100 responses, then I'll pick based on quality and not quantity.In the end, I want to see which credit card is the best for the majority of Americans. This could also lead to a discussion on how many cards one should own, but we'll save that for another time.So, let's see what you've got. Let me know which card you believe is best. You may comment below or you can email me.The contest will end at 5pm on Sunday, July 18th, 2010, Mountain Time. (This is 1pm Pacific Time, 4pm Eastern.) If you need an extra day to get your entry, I'll consider that as well.I'm looking forward to reading your entries and, more importantly, finding the best credit card for most Americans.Ask the Reader / Credit CardsI\u2019m always leery of what credit card offers are all about because they can change at any time. I\u2019ve never had anything but good experiences with my Bank One credit card (I know, I know, Chase), but I always pay in full every month and don\u2019t do any balances transfers or anything so I don\u2019t really care if I have the lowest rates possible. If I ever go into debt, then that\u2019s a different story. I do love the cash back though.If the best credit card for Americans would have the lowest rates possible with no balance transfers or interest, it would be the Discover More card.The current rate is 7.99% for purchases and 7.99% for balance transfers.The interest rate doesn\u2019t change throughout the year.There is no annual fee, but you can get a $25 gift card if you apply through the Gift Card Mall.No annual fee on the card, free for one year with no balance transfer.Beyond that, I think what is best for the majority is the Citi Rewards Card. This card offers two different rewards programs: ThankYou points and AAdvantage miles. The card offers a low interest rate of 6.9% and no annual fee. If I could use a different card as a secondary card, I would pick up one of the rewards cards since they both offer free flights, but there is no point in getting another credit card unless you need the points for a flight.This is my choice, as well. I pay it off every month, and the annual percentage rate has been under 7% since I got it. I\u2019m looking forward to the new Citi Forward card, which will pay off my balance after 12 months, at an interest rate of 0%.I agree. If I could, I\u2019d have one of those cards in my wallet. I\u2019m so happy with my Discover card and can\u2019t wait for it to go away. It\u2019s one of my favorites.My answer is the same as a few others. I use a rewards card for all of my purchases. Right now it\u2019s the Barclaycard Arrival Rewards card which has a 1.5% cash back rate. The only downside is the foreign transaction fee, but I travel so much I haven\u2019t found anything with better rewards.The rewards program is so great that I\u2019m considering not applying for other cards at all and instead use the one I already have. I just haven\u2019t gotten to the point where I\u2019ve used the rewards enough to justify giving up the 2% back I would get with a new card.I use the rewards card because I\u2019m cheap. I don\u2019t want to pay 5-10% in interest every year.As I said on my blog post, I don\u2019t have any credit card debt. So for me, the lowest possible interest rate is the best thing to have. My card, however, is a \u201crewards\u201d card, so I don\u2019t get that lowest rate.I do love my rewards, but I\u2019d have to say that I don\u2019t know which would be the best card, because there are so many factors at play. If I could only have one card, I\u2019d say I would use a no fee, low-interest card.If I could, I\u2019d use a rewards card and use the rewards to pay off the card in full every month. That way I would get some benefits from a rewards card, and still have a low interest rate.I think I would have to agree with the Discover card with no annual fee and a lower interest rate. I know that I can\u2019t pay off my balance in full every month (I\u2019m too irresponsible) so I think it\u2019s better to pay low interest and avoid paying it in the first place.I\u2019d have to go with the Discover More.My answer is Discover More, too. They have the lowest rate I can find and no annual fee. My husband has the Chase Freedom, which he loves, but since he\u2019s on a fixed income now it\u2019s harder to get his credit line up enough to get the points he was getting. I use a rewards card for all my purchases, but there are times I\u2019ve been overcharged or paid more than I should have and I wish I had a low rate on my purchases. I have the USAA Classic Mastercard which gives me 1.5% back on all purchases. It is paid in full each month. The rate is about 7.7% which is pretty good for a low credit card but not the lowest. I do wish I could pay interest on a card with a lower rate, but I have no debt and don\u2019t need the extra money.Mike, here is my answer\u2026The credit card that I think most people will benefit from in terms of lower interest rates, rewards, etc. is probably the Amex Everyday card that pays 10% cash back at selected places. However, since that is not an option to many people, I would pick the Discover More card as the best all around card because of its low rate, low fees and flexibility.For most Americans the card that\u2019s probably best is the Discover More card. With a 7.99% rate for new card holders, there\u2019s not much better than that. However, if you don\u2019t like Discover because they\u2019re a little too liberal with your card, then a Citi card might be a better option. There are currently a few 0% interest rates out there. But, like I said, those don\u2019t last very long. I know you said \u201cthe best card\u201d, but there really isn\u2019t any one card that\u2019s ideal. The best card is going to be a 0% rate if you can get one. However, I think the Discover More is still the card to go with.I like the rewards cards, but I like a good rate, too, so I guess I\u2019ll go with the Discover More Card.I think the best card would be the Capital One Venture card, which offers an annual fee of $0, a variable APR of 9.9%, and no foreign transaction fee. I would choose the Capital One Venture card for the simple reason that it is not a rewards card. The reason for choosing a rewards card over the Capital One Venture card is to be able to get the benefit of the rewards in the form of cash back to pay down the credit card debt.I would recommend the AMEX Blue card. This is one of the best credit cards on the market. It offers a 0% rate, a generous limit, and a bunch of other perks. The AMEX Blue card is best used as a tool to eliminate debt because the interest rate will never be higher than 0%.I would choose the Discover More card. My husband and I have both signed up for the new 0% rate that Discover is offering, and our credit card debt is about $40,000. I know it sounds like a lot, but we have been paying on our credit card for years, and the interest rates have just kept creeping up and up. We also have 0% rate cards, but they only last for 18 months, and then we have to pay interest. This 0% rate that we are getting with Discover will be in effect for 21 months, which will give us a little more time to get our finances in order. We don\u2019t have a balance transfer offer, but we will have about 21 months to pay off the card before the interest rate kicks in, so I think it will be a good deal for us.This is a really tough question because there are so many different factors that go into deciding which credit card is best. There are the low-interest credit cards, then there are the ones with high rewards, and then there are the cash-back rewards credit cards.Personally, I think the best credit card for most people is the Discover More card. It has a low interest rate of 7.99%, which is better than most of the other credit cards. It also has no annual fee, so it is a very economical choice.Discover Card (I have the Rewards card). 0% for a year, then 10.99% after. Low balance transfer fee. Low annual fee.My answer would have to be the Barclaycard Arrival World Mastercard. You\u2019re able to redeem your points for a variety of things and it has a low annual fee, but the points expire after a few months.I would say the Discover More Card for the low interest rate and no annual fee.If you\u2019re going to do an internet-only poll then you should at least provide some of your own personal information as the poll taker.My choice would be the Citi Forward Card. You can get a $50 gift card and 1.5% cash back if you sign up. This is a great offer, and it\u2019s very low interest. However, there is no fee for the first 12 months and then it\u2019s $10 after that. There\u2019s also no annual fee.I like the Citi Forward Card. It has a very low interest rate and no annual fee. I think this is the best card for most Americans because of the low interest rate and no annual fee.I think the best credit card is the Discover card with the low interest rate. However, I also think the best credit card for most Americans is the Capital One VentureOne card.The best credit card is the Barclaycard Arrival Plus World MasterCard. This is a cashback card, but you have to use the miles to travel or you lose them. However, it is the best deal on the market because you can get 2x miles on the first $50,000 spent on the card in a year and then 1.25x miles after that. There is a 0% interest introductory offer and then a 9.9% APR after that.I have two answers for you. First, the Citi Forward card because it\u2019s so low interest (0%). Second, the Chase Freedom rewards card for it\u2019s great rewards program.My answer would be the Discover More card, which is my current card. The rate is low, no annual fee, and offers a 0% APR for 12 months.I would have to say the Discover More card for the low interest rate and the fact that it has no annual fee.I am an Amex person. I get 2.5% cashback on almost everything I buy, and there are no foreign transaction fees.That being said, the best deal I\u2019ve seen is Discover More. They are offering a 100% bonus on your first $1,000 in spending, meaning that if you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months you will receive a $200 statement credit. This deal only lasts until September 30th. After that, it goes down to 50% bonus, then 25%, then 10%, and finally 0%.I think that Discover More is the best card to start with. It has no annual fee and a low interest rate. I\u2019m sure there are other cards that would work better for some people. I\u2019m just going to say Discover More.The best credit card is the Discover More card. It has a low interest rate and no annual fee.I would have to say that the best credit card is the one with the lowest interest rate. I personally think the Discover More card is a good choice for that reason.I am a Chase Sapphire Preferred Cardholder and would have to say that that is the best credit card for most Americans because of the cash back and the 15% discount on purchases made through Chase.I have the Barclays CashForward card, which is one of the best credit cards for people with bad credit. It has a 0% interest rate and no annual fee.I would have to say that the best credit card for most Americans is the Chase Freedom card. It has a 0% introductory APR for 12 months, followed by a 9.9% APR after that. It also offers 5% cashback on rotating categories that change every 3 months, with no cap on how much you can earn in rewards.I would have to say the Chase Freedom card. It has a 0% introductory APR for 12 months, followed by a 9.9% APR after that. It also offers 5% cashback on rotating categories that change every 3 months, with no cap on how much you can earn in rewards.Discover is my choice. It has the lowest interest rate.I would have to say the Discover More card, which offers a 0% APR for 12 months. This is a great card for those who have high credit card debt. I know some people who have this card and it has saved them a lot of money over the years.The best card is Discover More. You can earn a 0% interest rate on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months.I think the best credit card for most Americans would be the Barclaycard Arrival World Mastercard. It has no annual fee, and you earn rewards points on all purchases. You can use those points to redeem for gift cards, airline miles, cash back, or travel.I have to agree with your post about Discover More. I have the card and it\u2019s great. I don\u2019t know why people say it\u2019s not as good as it used to be, because I\u2019ve never had a problem with it. I always get my money back and they have a great rewards program.I would choose the Discover More card. It has a low interest rate and no annual fee.I would say the Chase Sapphire Preferred is the best credit card. I personally am a fan of the Chase Freedom card as well.It has been a while since I have been on the hunt for the best credit card. However, after a little bit of research, I think I have found the best credit card for Americans. It is the Discover More card. I chose this card because it has a very low interest rate and no annual fee.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.My current card is a Capital One Platinum Card. The downside is that there is no rewards program, however I've had the card for more than 10 years and they've never jacked up my interest rate (as has happened with my AMEX).Another one I'm considering is the Chase Sapphire Preferred. It's got a $45 annual fee but has no foreign transaction fees, and a pretty good rewards program. It's got a very low interest rate too.There are plenty of other cards out there, and I'm sure you guys can give me some suggestions.</s>",

And for those people, I would definitely recommend a travel card.The cards I\u2019m talking about here are all good cards for most consumers, and are very versatile. They offer 0% APR financing for 12 months and up to 18 months, and they have good cash-back or rewards programs. You also have the ability to transfer your points to frequent flyer miles. If you\u2019re a traveler, that\u2019s the kind of card you want to get.There are other benefits to getting the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card. In addition to 0% APR financing, you also get a 10,000-point sign-up bonus (worth about $1,250). This card also gives you three times the points per dollar spent at restaurants and travel, which is worth a lot more.The Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card is one of the most flexible, well-rounded cards available to consumers.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. The most important feature of a credit card, in my mind, is its APR rate (annual percentage rate) because it determines how much money you'll spend over time in interest. If a card has a low rate and no annual fee, it's ideal.My personal favorite, because it offers no annual fee, is the Bank of America Travel Rewards Credit Card, which offers 1.5 points for every dollar spent and a $0 balance transfer fee. This is an excellent travel card because of the free Global Entry application and rewards points that can be redeemed for statement credits, gift cards, and travel.But I'm interested to know if you've discovered any other cards that are just as good as the BofA Travel Rewards card. Feel free to tell me about them in the comments below. I'm looking forward to your feedback!My favorite card is the Wells Fargo Propel American Express. It earns 3x points per dollar on eating, ordering in, and gas station, 1.5x points per dollar on all other purchases, plus a $100 cash reward after spending $1,000 within 3 months. The card also has no annual fee.The Bank of America Travel Rewards Card is the best deal on the market.I have the B of A Travel Rewards card and really like it. But, I also have the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. With the CSP, you can redeem your points for statement credits to cover any travel or dining purchase of $100 or more. So I like to use the Chase for those kinds of things and the BofA card for everything else.I love the Capital One Venture Card.I also have the Sapphire preferred card, and I'd agree with what Jim said.I like that Chase Sapphire Preferred, too!Capital One is pretty awesome, too.I have the Discover It and like it very much.I'm not a big fan of travel rewards cards. I'd rather save my points for airfare and hotels than save a few cents on each purchase I make.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.My best offer came from AMEX, with a 0% interest rate for the first 9 months. After that, the interest rate will be between 12.9 and 15.9% based on your credit rating. I haven't received the card yet, so I don't know if the AMEX Blue card has the ability to be linked to multiple bank accounts and credit cards, but I'm assuming it does.There's also an option for a 0% interest rate for the first 6 months with an interest rate after that ranging from 11.9 to 19.9% based on your credit rating. There's also a no annual fee. I have the Visa version and it works well for me.It depends on what you're looking for. I personally like the no annual fee and 0% for 9 months. I'm hoping it'll allow me to make my transition from student loans to mortgage without stressing about my credit card debt.I'm a big fan of Bank of America and Wells Fargo, but I'm not sure if there are any low interest offers on them.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.Personally, I'm a fan of the PenFed Pathfinder Rewards credit card because of it's cash-back rewards program. However, I do find the APR a little bit higher than what I would like.The reason why I like the PenFed card is because it's cash-back rewards program is similar to the Amex SimplyCash rewards program (my favorite Amex rewards program).For those of you who don't already know, here are the details.Cash Back Rewards Program: PenFed offers two levels of cash back rewards. Each level varies slightly in the number of rewards points and rewards rate you will receive. For PenFed Platinum credit cardholders (and their immediate family members), you will receive an extra 10% cash back rewards bonus.SimplyCash is the name of the Amex card that has a cash-back rewards program similar to PenFed Platinum. The cash-back rewards are identical to those offered by PenFed.SimplyCash rewards are also similar to the Discover It card, in that you receive 5% cash back on purchases in rotating categories each quarter, up to $1,500 in purchases each quarter.Both Amex and Discover also offer intro APRs on both purchases and balance transfers. However, I do prefer PenFed's cash-back rewards program because it allows you to receive up to 2.5% in cash-back rewards (similar to the Discover It).The reason I like cash-back rewards is because the rewards are usually deposited directly into my checking account.Low APR: The PenFed credit card has a variable APR of 9.99%. The only Amex card that offers a lower APR is the SimplyCash from American Express (9.74%).Low Intro APR: As I mentioned above, the PenFed credit card offers a low intro APR of 0% for 12 months on both purchases and balance transfers.Personal Financial Security: The Federal Credit Union offers financial services to members and non-members alike. However, if you are a member of the Federal Credit Union, you will enjoy lower fees. Additionally, you may qualify for more financial services and lower interest rates.As you can see, the PenFed credit card offers a combination of perks that no other credit card company currently offers.As far as I know, PenFed is the only credit card company that offers cash-back rewards with a low APR and a low intro APR. In addition, PenFed offers low fees for both members and non-members alike.Additionally, the PenFed credit card is easy to qualify for because you do not have to be a member of the Federal Credit Union.What do you think of the PenFed credit card?Do you prefer a low intro APR, a low interest rate, or cash-back rewards?I would say the PenFed card is a good deal. The low APR is important and the cash-back rewards are a bonus. It's a bit more complicated than the Amex SimplyCash though, and it's not as easy to earn the full 5% in rewards.I have the American Express SimplyCash Plus card and I think it is a great product. I would definitely recommend this to someone who's looking for a cash-back rewards card.I think the cash-back rewards program of PenFed is better than the Amex SimplyCash.What type of credit card do you use?I use the PenFed credit card.I use an Amex card.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.For my money, I'd have to say the Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card. I know, I know... it's not the best rewards card out there, but that's not why I love it.What's so great about the Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card?You'll love it for its combination of perks and flexibility. Sure, it's not going to get you a huge return on spending. But it offers a ton of other perks that make it worth having in your wallet.Perks are a great way to get more bang for your buck. You'll want to look for a card that offers the biggest return on spending possible for you and your lifestyle. This isn't a card for someone who travels a ton for business. If you're looking for a card like that, check out our guide to the best travel credit cards.This card offers a sign-up bonus of 50,000 bonus points. That's a $500 value when redeemed through the Chase Ultimate Rewards program for travel.The Chase Ultimate Rewards program offers travelers incredible flexibility. You can get cash back, buy gift cards, transfer points to travel partners, or book travel directly through the Chase portal.One of the best ways to maximize your travel rewards is through the Chase portal. You can book just about any hotel, flight, or rental car through the portal. Just keep in mind that you won't be able to get the full 2% cash back rate when using the portal. You can also only book travel using the Chase portal once every 120 days. This makes it great for travelers that use their points in place of miles or redeem points for travel rewards every 6 months or so.The card also has no foreign transaction fees. This makes it great for travelers who are planning to use the card while traveling internationally. This perk will save you a lot of money. I've written an entire article on travel rewards cards, that might help you decide whether this is the right card for you.The card also comes with tons of perks, some of which you can't get on any other card.This card offers free WiFi when you book through the Chase portal. If you're traveling a lot for business, this is a great perk.You also get Priority Pass Select membership for two free years. The Priority Pass Select membership allows you and up to two guests free entrance into over 1,000 airport lounges worldwide. The card also comes with an annual travel protection benefit of up to $1,000 per trip for covered reasons such as theft or injury.Finally, you get car rental insurance, purchase protection, extended warranty, and return protection. All of this is for a $0 annual fee.If you have a large purchase in mind and can't pay it off right away, it's great to have the flexibility of a credit card that doesn't charge a huge APR. That way you can put the purchase on a low APR card, pay it off over time, and still have the cash you need.The Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card comes with a 12-month 0% APR for purchases. You can use this card to make a purchase and pay it off in 12 months without paying interest.That being said, it's best if you pay off the balance in full before the 0% APR expires. Otherwise, you'll be stuck with a huge balance and high APRs.You can read my full Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card review here.How about the Sapphire Reserve\u00ae Card?I have a love-hate relationship with this card. I love the sign-up bonus but hate the APRs. If you're interested in this card, check out the full review.Have you had any experience with either card?

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I recently decided to change from my old credit card to a new one, and I'd love to hear about your experiences.I've been working from home for the past year. I can't count how many times I've tried to order a coffee and realized I didn't have cash with me. I always assumed there were lots of places that took credit cards. But when I looked at the ATM machine, I saw \"Cash Only.\" I was out of cash and without any way to get more. It's hard to imagine my life without ATM access.Throughout the past year, I've been collecting a list of credit cards with low interest rates.While working from home, I find that I get hungry a lot. I like to go out and find something to eat, but I don't always know what's around the corner. To avoid overeating, I often take along a bag of pretzels. I like pretzels that are warm, crunchy, and salty.I used to be in sales, and I remember traveling to conventions and trade shows, where sales reps spent lots of time on the road. They'd get in their car, drive all over the country, and stay in hotels when they got there.If they were in the hospitality business, they'd also have to deal with travel agents. Those guys would be calling all the time, trying to sell them tickets, hotel rooms, and transportation. They needed some way to keep those people away.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.Here's my suggestion: If you pay off your balance in full each month and want a card with no annual fee that's designed with that type of consumer in mind, the Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card ($0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95) should make your shortlist.This card is best for someone who:Makes purchases in the U.S. and doesn't mind foreign transaction fees. (Learn more in our guide on what to look for in a travel credit card.)Is concerned about building their credit score. The Quicksilver card's low interest rates, low APR, and low credit utilization rate are important factors in building credit.A high-earning card that rewards you for paying in fullThe Quicksilver Card from Capital One has a 0% introductory annual percentage rate (APR) for 15 months. It also features a low ongoing APR (13.99%-23.99% variable APR) and an impressive rewards rate. Cardholders earn 1.5% cash back on every purchase.That is a very high earning rate and compares to many other travel rewards cards. The Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card earns 2x miles per dollar spent (up to $50,000 per calendar year; then 1.5x), while the Capital One\u00ae VentureOne\u00ae Rewards Credit Card earns 1.25x miles on all purchases. The Capital One\u00ae Venture Rewards Card is the only card I recommend for most business travelers, however, because of its large welcome bonus, ability to redeem for any travel purchase at a one-to-one ratio (and no blackout dates), and generous 10,000-mile annual bonus offer after spending $20,000 on the card during a calendar year.But if you prefer a card that rewards you even more than the Venture card, then I recommend the Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae X Rewards Credit Card ($395 annual fee), which features 10x miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.The Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card rewards rate applies to all purchases, and you don't have to worry about accruing additional or specialized categories. However, you do need to use the card to make everyday purchases, such as groceries and gas, if you want to earn 1.5% cash back.I don't recommend using the Quicksilver card for any purchases that you could earn more rewards on. And I don't recommend using it to pay for travel expenses if you plan to redeem your miles or cash back for travel, because you'll earn only a fraction of the total rewards value.The Quicksilver card's rewards rate is high compared to many other cards and its ability to earn a substantial return is another reason why it's a solid choice for building your credit.The Quicksilver card doesn't charge an annual fee for the first year and then a $95 annual fee. I prefer this because many cards charge an annual fee and also have an introductory 0% APR offer, which can lure you into the trap of spending money that you'll need to pay interest on after the offer expires.The Capital One Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card's cash-back rewards are pretty simple to understand: 1.5% cash back on every purchase you make, with no caps or limits.Cash rewards are deposited into your account each month as a statement credit. You'll then be able to see your rewards in your account online.I like the simplicity of the Quicksilver card's rewards program. Capital One has a bunch of other cards that offer great perks, such as bonus categories or large welcome bonuses. But those cards can be confusing, especially for beginners, because they have many moving parts.The Capital One Quicksilver Card also has a long introductory APR period and a low ongoing APR, both of which will help you pay off your credit card balance and improve your credit score.When the Quicksilver card's introductory APR period ends, your ongoing APR is 13.99%-23.99% variable APR.The Quicksilver card doesn't have any fees. That includes no foreign transaction fees, which is important if you're looking to redeem the cash rewards for travel.The Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card does come with some drawbacks.For one, you'll pay foreign transaction fees when you use your card abroad. The fee is 3%, and it will lower the rewards rate you earn. But it's still a great option to use for international travel because it's a no-fee card and you can earn cash back rewards even when you use it outside the U.S.This card also doesn't offer additional or specialized bonus categories. That means you won't earn more points on dining out or gas, which can increase your rewards value.This card also doesn't come with a sign-up bonus or a travel rewards bonus. The lack of a welcome bonus and travel rewards offer makes it a poor choice for someone who frequently uses their credit card for travel, especially if they're looking to redeem the cash rewards for travel.In that case, I recommend Capital One's Venture line of cards. The Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card and the Capital One\u00ae VentureOne\u00ae Rewards Credit Card both come with huge bonus offers.Capital One Venture cards also come with the Capital One Wallet app.The Venture card's $95 annual fee is on par with many other travel rewards cards and makes it a great value if you're looking to use it for travel. The VentureOne card has no annual fee and a smaller welcome bonus, but is still a decent choice for someone who's looking to build their credit and start traveling with a credit card.Both the Venture and VentureOne cards come with no foreign transaction fees, 1.25x or 2x miles for every dollar spent (up to $50,000 per year; then 1x), and a 100,000-mile sign-up bonus.If you're just looking for a good rewards card that doesn't charge an annual fee, the Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card ($0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $95) is a great option.It's easy to use because you're able to earn rewards on all of your purchases and the rewards are credited to your account as cash rewards, which can then be used as you see fit.The card's introductory APR of 0% for 15 months is also impressive, and it's not too hard to qualify for this introductory offer if you have good credit. But once the introductory period expires, you'll pay a variable interest rate that ranges from 13.99%-23.99%, which is a little higher than some of its competitors.The Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card's rewards rate is 1.5% cash back on every purchase you make. You'll also receive a $150 cash-back bonus after you spend $500 on purchases within the first three months.The Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card is a great choice for someone who wants to earn cash rewards with no annual fee.However, it's not a great choice if you want to earn points or miles for travel. Instead, I recommend the Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card or the Capital One\u00ae VentureOne\u00ae Rewards Credit Card if you want to use your card for travel.I recommend the Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card for most travelers, because it's the only card that gives you the opportunity to earn a ton of miles without having to worry about category spending caps.The Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card earns 2x miles on all purchases (up to $50,000 per year; then 1.5x) and has a 0% introductory APR offer for 15 months. It also has no annual fee and a large welcome bonus.The Capital One\u00ae VentureOne\u00ae Rewards Credit Card, which I'll talk about more later, is a good choice for beginners because it has a smaller welcome bonus offer.If you're looking for a cash-back rewards card with no annual fee, you might consider the Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card. It's a solid choice that gives you the chance to earn a decent amount of cash rewards.But if you want a travel rewards card, I recommend Capital One's Venture line of cards, which include the Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card and the Capital One\u00ae VentureOne\u00ae Rewards Credit Card.Both the Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card and the Capital One\u00ae VentureOne\u00ae Rewards Credit Card offer great travel perks.The Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card comes with a 0% introductory APR for 15 months, no annual fee, and a $200 travel credit that is credited to your card annually. It also has a 100,000-mile welcome bonus and is the only card that offers travel rewards for purchases that you make abroad.The Capital One\u00ae VentureOne\u00ae Rewards Credit Card is a good choice if you're a beginner and are just starting out with credit cards. It has a smaller welcome bonus and an APR that is slightly higher than the Venture card, but still gives you a chance to earn a lot of miles.The Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card is a good choice for someone who's looking to earn cash rewards.But if you're looking for travel rewards, you should probably look elsewhere.This is a pretty good question. I don't know how to answer this question without knowing what your credit score is.But if you're a beginner with a low credit score and are looking to build your credit, I'd suggest getting a card that offers a low interest rate and low annual fee.These are two of the best cards on the market today, because they have no annual fees and low APRs. The Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card is a good choice because it offers a 0% introductory APR for 15 months.But if you're looking for a card that will give you more cash-back rewards, I'd recommend the Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card. It offers a 0% introductory APR for 15 months and has no annual fee.But if you want to earn cash back, I'd recommend the Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card. It's a great card that offers a lot of flexibility and is easy to use.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. It is of course subjective but I'd be curious to know what card most people would recommend to someone who is looking for a solid credit card.It is a very broad question and it would depend on a variety of factors. My advice, which I think is very reasonable would be to focus on building up credit first. Then, once you have 6 months to a year of positive history, then you can get a credit card and find one that fits your needs.Credit cards are not that difficult. First you need to have good credit (600+), then you need to find a card that you can qualify for. It sounds like you want to find the best card and I'm not sure you can find it without good credit and a year or so of positive history.Good credit is your starting point.It's a little hard to answer because your definition of what you think is the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility could be completely different from other people.I have a few credit cards, but the two I always use are my American Express Blue Cash Everyday and my Chase Sapphire Preferred. These are both good cards with low interest rates (10% and 15% respectively) and are great for earning cash back. I get the equivalent of about 3% cash back on most of my purchases. For example, I got 5% back for groceries and gas using my Blue Cash Everyday card. Both are very flexible and the rewards don't expire like a lot of rewards cards.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.In 2016, Chase introduced its own no annual fee version of the Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card. The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card now charges a $95 annual fee, but is also available without an annual fee.While I personally love and prefer the no annual fee version of the Sapphire Preferred Card, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best credit card for you. Here\u2019s a comparison of the two versions of the Sapphire Preferred.One of the major perks that comes with the Sapphire Preferred Card is the signup bonus. While you\u2019ll get the same signup bonus, the no annual fee Sapphire Preferred earns the bonus faster than its fee-based counterpart. The reason for this is that in order to be eligible for the signup bonus, you must spend a minimum of $4,000 in the first 3 months your account is open.The fee-based Sapphire Preferred card charges $95 per year, and while that fee can be offset by the value you get from the card, it\u2019s still a hassle to pay. As a result, the annual fee is one of the biggest differences between the two cards.The Sapphire Preferred\u2019s signup bonus is $500 when you spend $4,000 in the first three months. That\u2019s a 12.5% return on your spending, and a 1.25% return on all your other spending.The Chase Sapphire Preferred no annual fee card has a much smaller signup bonus.This is a good bonus, but if you spend at least $4,000 in the first three months, it is worth it to pay the annual fee for the Sapphire Preferred. If you don\u2019t spend that much, the $0 annual fee Sapphire Preferred will get you less value from the card, since the signup bonus is worth less than the $0 annual fee.On the other hand, you can always pay the $95 annual fee and use the 50,000 Ultimate Rewards points you get from the bonus. That way, you get a 10% return on your spending.When it comes to rewards, there are two ways to redeem Chase Ultimate Rewards points. You can either redeem them directly for cash, or you can transfer your points to one of Chase\u2019s airline partners. I typically transfer my points to United MileagePlus or Southwest, but I also like that I can book travel through Chase.The Chase Sapphire Preferred no annual fee version of the card offers fewer redemption options than its fee-based counterpart. While the fee-based Sapphire Preferred offers 10 different redemption options, the no annual fee card only offers three redemption options.Here\u2019s the important part: you will only be able to redeem your points for cash if you don\u2019t pay the annual fee on the card. If you pay the annual fee, you can use your points to book travel, or transfer them to one of Chase\u2019s airline partners.It\u2019s easy to see how this change came about. For one thing, it makes sense that a no annual fee credit card would offer fewer redemption options than a fee-based credit card. That\u2019s just the nature of the card. The more benefits a card offers, the more expensive it is. In the case of the fee-based Sapphire Preferred, the card is $95 per year.On the other hand, it makes less sense that the no annual fee version of the card only offers three redemption options. For example, the Sapphire Preferred no annual fee card doesn\u2019t allow you to redeem your points for gift cards, cash, or merchandise. So why not offer all of those redemption options? I guess it\u2019s the same reason that many airline co-branded cards don\u2019t offer the same redemption options as their non-co-branded siblings: co-branded cards typically have lower redemption values than non-co-branded cards. That\u2019s why the fee-based Sapphire Preferred offers the option of redeeming your points for 1.25 cents each, while the Sapphire Preferred no annual fee card doesn\u2019t.Which brings me to my next point: 1.25 cents per point is a bad value.There are three travel redemption options for the Sapphire Preferred no annual fee card. You can redeem your points for travel booked through Chase, for cash, or you can transfer your points to an airline partner.The three airline partners you can transfer your points to are United MileagePlus, Southwest, and British Airways.For comparison, the Sapphire Preferred fee-based card offers more travel redemption options. You can redeem your points for travel booked through Chase, for cash, or you can transfer your points to airline partners.If you\u2019re interested in transferring your Ultimate Rewards points to Southwest, you\u2019ll want to keep in mind that you\u2019ll only earn 1.125 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent when you use the Sapphire Preferred card to pay for travel at Southwest.com. If you spend $2,000 on the card and travel exclusively with Southwest Airlines, you\u2019ll get 2,250 points instead of 2,270 points.Overall, you\u2019ll get a better value if you\u2019re transferring your points to an airline partner.As far as rewards rates go, the Sapphire Preferred no annual fee card has a lower base rate than the fee-based Sapphire Preferred.The Sapphire Preferred no annual fee card offers 2 points per dollar spent at restaurants and travel, and 1 point per dollar spent on all other purchases. In comparison, the Sapphire Preferred fee-based card offers 2 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on travel booked through Chase, 2 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on dining, and 1 Ultimate Rewards point per dollar spent on all other purchases.Here\u2019s the important part: there\u2019s no difference in the rewards rates between the Sapphire Preferred no annual fee card and the Sapphire Preferred fee-based card if you use the no annual fee card to pay for travel booked through Chase.So you might be thinking: since there\u2019s no difference in the rewards rates between the no annual fee card and the fee-based card if you use the no annual fee card to pay for travel booked through Chase, why bother paying the annual fee on the fee-based card?For starters, you\u2019ll get more Ultimate Rewards points. And while the rewards rate of the Sapphire Preferred card is identical to that of the Ink Preferred Business card, I prefer to redeem my points for travel instead of for cash.The Chase Sapphire Preferred no annual fee card has the same signup bonus as the fee-based Sapphire Preferred card. The fee-based Sapphire Preferred card has a higher rewards rate, but the rewards rate difference is offset by the fact that the fee-based card offers more redemption options. If you\u2019re going to use the no annual fee card to pay for travel booked through Chase, there\u2019s no difference in the rewards rate between the two cards. But if you\u2019re going to use the no annual fee card to redeem your points for cash, gift cards, or merchandise, you\u2019ll get more value from the fee-based card.Overall, I\u2019d recommend that you sign up for the Sapphire Preferred card with the annual fee. The signup bonus is worth it. However, I wouldn\u2019t recommend the no annual fee Sapphire Preferred card unless you\u2019re only using the card to pay for travel booked through Chase.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. What's the card you choose?The answer to this question largely depends on what you\u2019re looking for in a credit card. If you need a low interest rate, you might want a fixed APR card like the Chase Slate, or a balance transfer card like the Citi Simplicity Card.If you want to earn points for rewards, you might like the American Express\u00ae Gold Card, or the Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card. If you\u2019d rather just earn cash back, you might like the Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express or the BankAmericard\u00ae credit card.If you\u2019re just starting out, you may want to go with a card like the Discover It\u00ae Miles or the Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card to get some experience with credit.This card is good for those with a credit score of at least 700.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I have several, and use them in combination. I think that most people have no idea what kind of perks and rewards are available with credit cards, so I figured that I'd ask, here. What is the one card that you like most?I also like Chase Freedom Rewards. 5% cash back on all purchases and no annual fees. I have a personal credit card and a business credit card through Chase, and I never pay a fee to have them and use them. I like that Chase offers different rewards for different types of purchases. I do most of my shopping at local businesses and I usually take the rewards that best fit my shopping needs.The one I like the best is a Chase Freedom card. I have a Discover card that has been a pain in my you know what, so I'll probably end up canceling it. I don't like Discover anymore, since they changed the terms of the rewards and now it's a pain to get ahold of anyone there.If you're gonna have a credit card, you gotta have the Freedom Rewards card. I do all my credit card shopping through there, and I've gotten some great rewards in the past few months.This is the card that I love to use for online shopping. They have some good rewards, and I'm not paying any fees for having the card, so I like it for that. I use it for all my online shopping needs, which is pretty much everything. They've been pretty good to me so far, so I'm sticking with it for now.I know this card from my mom. She used to have a credit card with that name and used to love to use it to buy things. She always said that she got some great rewards from it, and I believe her. I know that there are many credit card offers that give you a free something for every purchase, or something like that. I think that I'll just sign up for that kind of credit card, since I never pay any fees for having my credit cards.I have a few credit cards, and I use them depending on what kind of thing I'm doing. I like them because they give me a good rate and they always give me a free something with each purchase. It seems like there's always something new and exciting that they offer with each card, so I just keep using them.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I recently received a credit card for a new client. For the most part, I am happy with the offer. However, I wish it included some additional features, such as no foreign transaction fees, no balance transfer fees, and travel and purchase protection.I am currently carrying two credit cards with different interest rates and different levels of financial flexibility. In an ideal world, I'd love to be able to consolidate my payments and be able to enjoy the rewards from one credit card. I've looked at a few travel rewards cards, such as Chase Sapphire Reserve, Citi Prestige, and American Express\u00ae Gold Card, but most of these cards are not designed to carry a balance.I believe that one of the most important perks of a credit card is the potential to earn rewards on spending. But I think that one of the most important features of a credit card is the opportunity to consolidate debt and pay down debt quickly.While I have two credit cards right now, I'm curious to see how other credit cards compare in terms of interest rates, rewards, and financial flexibility.Do any other readers use a credit card as a payment system or as a debt consolidation tool? Which credit card offers the best combination of features?I have a very specific reason for asking this question. I'm considering using a new credit card to pay down student loan debt. I currently have two different credit cards. One has a low interest rate and offers no rewards. The other offers 1.5% cash back on every purchase and has a low introductory rate. I am currently considering consolidating my debt on this new credit card.The new card is from Discover. It is called Discover it\u00ae \u2013 It's Cash Back Rewards. It is a cash back credit card. The cash back rate is 1.5% on all purchases. I don't have a specific reason to choose this credit card. I would like to know which credit cards offer the best combination of rewards, low interest rates, and financial flexibility.In the past, I've been offered rewards cards with great sign up bonuses and rewards. However, I was never happy with the level of flexibility offered by these cards. As a result, I've never been happy with the benefits offered by these cards.I'm interested to know which credit cards offer the best combination of features.Do any of you have any recommendations?Labels: American Express\u00ae Gold Card, balances, Citi Prestige, Chase Sapphire Reserve, credit cards, Debt Consolidation, Discover it\u00ae \u2013 It's Cash Back Rewards, Interest Rates, rewards, student loans, travel rewardsHey Steve, I'm curious to know what are the advantages and disadvantages of a credit card. I don't think a lot of people know about the different types of credit cards. I'm wondering if anyone has experience with credit cards that they can share. I'm especially interested in the pros and cons of a credit card. Are there advantages and disadvantages? Do you know of any other credit cards out there that are worth looking at? I'd like to know what are some of the most important things to consider when deciding whether or not to use a credit card.Labels: Citi Prestige, Chase Sapphire Reserve, credit cards, Debt Consolidation, rewards, student loans, travel rewards</s>",

It's a personal financial assistant, one that's in your pocket and ready to help you manage your finances when you need it.I'm not talking about the basic features, such as cash back rewards, travel benefits, or insurance protections. Those are nice perks, but you can get those with many other credit cards.I'm talking about the benefits that can help you manage your cash flow and grow your savings over time. The things you can use right now to improve your personal finances.Too often we talk about credit cards and we focus on the cost. We look at how much interest we have to pay and whether or not we're getting cash back or rewards points. These are important questions, but they're only half of the story.The other half is how the credit card impacts your cash flow, and that's what really matters.The best credit cards give you access to financial tools that can grow your savings and help you manage your expenses and cash flow more effectively.This is the kind of credit card that's right for you:It's an open-ended line of credit. That means you can spend up to a pre-approved credit limit.It offers low interest rates, which is important because carrying a balance means you're going to pay interest on your balance each month. That means more money you can spend in other ways.It doesn't charge any balance transfer fees, which is a nice perk.It comes with a 0% interest introductory period, which means you don't have to pay interest on new purchases or balance transfers for a set period of time.It has a rewards program, which gives you a little extra cash back or travel miles for purchases you make.You can use the points to pay for part of your purchase, or you can redeem them for cash back.It has a long 0% interest introductory period, which is great because you can use it to consolidate credit card debt or to make a major purchase.It has a low balance transfer fee, which means you don't have to pay a lot of money to transfer your balance.You can get cash back for your purchases.It has a cash back rewards program, which gives you money back on your purchases.It offers 0% APR financing on your purchases.It has a rewards program that gives you points for spending on your card.It has no annual fee.You can get cash back for your purchases.You can get a low introductory rate on your purchases.It has a rewards program, which gives you cash back on purchases.You can use your points to get cash back on your purchases.You can get a low introductory rate on your balance transfers.It has a 0% APR introductory period on balance transfers.It has a rewards program that gives you points for balance transfers.The best credit cards are the ones that give you the most benefits and perks.

I have my monthly bill due and paid by the date. And if you are a member you always get the discount of course. I will never ever go back to Costco with out these credit cards.Why are all these questions coming out of your hat? This is the most ridiculous thing I've read today.Having an extra Costco card in the house might actually be a liability. Imagine what would happen if your spouse were to accidentally make a purchase on your card thinking it was theirs.I like having the Citi Costco Visa for the discount. I don't think Citi will be able to compete with AmEx for service. It would be interesting to see who would win if Citi tried to match the AmEx perks.Having an AmEx in your wallet gives me a good feeling. But I would much rather have a low APR, rewards card. I don't use my AmEx for small purchases, so the 2.5% discount wouldn't help me much.The rewards programs are nice, but I would never take a cashback reward over a lower APR.I'd love to know what you have in your wallet. And what you're doing to get that way.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.The survey results suggest that people are prioritizing perks over low interest rates. But, in general, we should be prioritizing low interest rates more than perks, and we'll see why in a moment.To conduct the survey, I posted a question on Reddit's /r/financialindependence (a community I'm a moderator of). It read: \"Which credit card offers the best combination of low interest rate and/or low fees, perks, and/or rewards?\"From the 48 responses I received, most people chose the Capital One Venture Rewards card. It's notable for its 0% APR intro period and large signup bonus. The card is best-in-class.Interestingly, though, 32% of respondents said they chose a card based on the rewards rate. That's a pretty large percentage, and shows that people aren't as obsessed with interest rates as I think they should be.I'm also concerned by the fact that only 2% of respondents said they choose cards based on low fees. That's a big problem, because I think it's the easiest way to lower your interest rate.What about you? Which credit card do you think offers the best combination of low interest rate and perks? Let me know in the comments!</s>",

For example, the Tangerine Money-Back Card offers cash back in the form of a cheque or an annual rewards bonus to their preferred charity.In the end, the best credit card for you will depend on your spending habits, your financial goals, and the current state of your finances.

I'm also hoping to earn a few rewards.Which credit card is better? And which card company do you think offers the best overall perks and low interest rates?The 0% interest rate card can actually give you a few years to pay it off and still pay less than if you took out a personal loan. So, if it's debt that you need to clear, I'd look at the one that's offering 0%.I'd rather have the no annual fee option.I like the idea of a low-rate credit card, which has an 18-month introductory period. The annual fee is low, so the benefits are pretty good.The low rate, low annual fee and no foreign transaction fees make this the better card.In the United States there are so many companies that are offering different credit cards to their customers and the credit card that you have, will depend on how much you are willing to pay monthly for that credit card.In my opinion, Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card is the better option since you get cash back rewards on purchases made with this credit card. This credit card has a 0% Intro APR offer and a low rate after that period of time and it also has a 0% Intro APR offer on purchases.You get rewards in the form of cash rewards, you can use the cash rewards to pay your bill or you can also redeem the cash rewards for an eGift Card. You can also redeem the cash rewards for a check or a statement credit.There is an annual fee of $0, but the best part is that you do not pay an annual fee.The 0% introductory offer on purchases is 15 months and it also has a low rate after that period of time.With the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card, you get unlimited 1.5% cash back rewards on every purchase made, which you can redeem at any time.In the United States there are so many companies that are offering different credit cards to their customers and the credit card that you have, will depend on how much you are willing to pay monthly for that credit card.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.Which credit card do you feel is the best choice for the typical consumer?Best overall card?I've always used the USAA card, and it's been great. I get the lowest interest rate possible, a small, reasonable balance, no balance transfer fees, and great rewards. My bank has a no interest period too, but I just like having the extra money with the USAA.I don't have a good answer to the question as I've never been a credit card user, though I think I'd be happier with USAA than with Discover.Best in the country I would say:Not necessarily in order.Credit card of the year, Discover ItI've had this card for a long time now, and I can't say enough good about it. The 5% cashback is incredible, and the 0% promotional period is always worth looking into when you're planning a big purchase.I also like that you can transfer a balance over and save on interest. I recently transferred over $10k at the beginning of the year, and now I'm paying 0% for nearly a year.Last edited by dp_bosco on Mon Jan 21, 2019 8:34 pm, edited 1 time in total.Post by dc2007 \u00bb Mon Jan 21, 2019 8:32 pmCredit cards have a few advantages for some people:1) You can use the card for things that you need to spend money on right now (in my case, gas and groceries) and pay it off in the full amount by the due date.2) If you're in a situation where you need a card, and you can pay off the full balance, a secured credit card might be the best option (you put money on the card that will cover your debt)3) Credit cards can be useful if you need to build credit. If you don't want to or can't pay for it in cash right now, that's not a good reason to use a credit card.Otherwise, I have always preferred to just save up for the expense and pay with cash.Post by jwc2248 \u00bb Mon Jan 21, 2019 8:47 pmI'm with you. A no interest card with no transfer fees is perfect for me.Post by dc2007 \u00bb Tue Jan 22, 2019 2:00 amI don't understand that. If you are using a cash back card, aren't you paying interest unless you pay the full balance every month?Post by dc2007 \u00bb Tue Jan 22, 2019 2:08 pmI don't know anything about that card, but a 0% APR on balance transfers is generally the best offer. If you can pay the balance off before the promo period expires, then you are fine. But if you can't, you'll want to do a balance transfer first and then make the balance-free credit card your new permanent card.Post by Dottie57 \u00bb Tue Jan 22, 2019 2:11 pmThat is not a cash back card. It's a 5% cash back card with no transfer fees (other than an initial one).Last edited by Dottie57 on Tue Jan 22, 2019 2:17 pm, edited 1 time in total.I would say that the Chase Sapphire Preferred is a great travel rewards card. It gives 2x points on travel/dining, plus it's 1x for everything else, so there is great flexibility there. Plus, the $95 annual fee is waived for the first year.It's not a cash back card.Post by ryman554 \u00bb Tue Jan 22, 2019 2:19 pmI would say that the Chase Sapphire Preferred is a great travel rewards card. It gives 2x points on travel/dining, plus it's 1x for everything else, so there is great flexibility there.But how much value is a point worth? A round trip flight to Europe or the Caribbean can cost 60,000 points or more. If you are going to use these for flights and not hotel stays, you would have to value each point at $20 to make the annual fee worthwhile. I guess it is worth it if you don't fly much, don't dine out very often, or don't go out very much.That's a good point about value. There are a lot of factors to consider in using a point for travel redemption. I use this calculator: https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/miles-and-points/1723344-2019-travel-calculator.htmlThere are a lot of variables. Here's one for a round-trip business class award to Europe from LA:Award type\tAirline\tOrigin to DestinationBusiness\tDelta Air Lines (Delta)\tLos Angeles International (LAX) toEurope\tAir France (AF), KLM Royal Dutch (KL), Delta Air Lines(DL)\tParis, France (CDG) toEurope\tAir France (AF), Delta Air Lines (DL), KLM Royal Dutch(KL)\tFrankfurt, Germany (FRA) toI would need a lot of those points to pay for a ticket, but it looks like I can get 1.12 cents of value out of it (and it's a one-way ticket).Post by Spherical \u00bb Tue Jan 22, 2019 3:03 pmThe Chase Sapphire Preferred is one of the most widely used travel reward cards. So, it does get used a lot for travel.I would say the most widely used travel reward card is the Chase Sapphire Preferred.Post by mattz \u00bb Tue Jan 22, 2019 4:52 pmPost by dc2007 \u00bb Tue Jan 22, 2019 11:18 pmI would use it for my cash back rewards program. I could go to Amazon.com and pay off my Amazon purchase with cash back points. I would do the same for iTunes.Post by dc2007 \u00bb Thu Jan 24, 2019 4:58 amFor some people, they would use cash back to save up for a major purchase. In other words, if you want to buy a TV for $500, you could get it and put the remaining $400 in your savings.Post by dc2007 \u00bb Thu Jan 24, 2019 6:33 pmIf I pay off a balance in a timely manner, I don't have to worry about interest.Post by dc2007 \u00bb Fri Jan 25, 2019 3:06 amThe Discover It card sounds like a good option for you, but make sure that you're not late on your payments.Post by dc2007 \u00bb Fri Jan 25, 2019 5:19 pmIf I get a card with a promotional rate for a period of time, and I use the card for what I normally spend, I'll pay that bill in full before the promotional period expires.Post by dc2007 \u00bb Sat Jan 26, 2019 2:10 pmThe best credit card, in my opinion, is the one you can use to get the most out of your spending.Post by dc2007 \u00bb Sun Jan 27, 2019 4:55 amI think I'd take the USAA Visa Platinum card because you can earn rewards and it has a low interest rate.Post by dc2007 \u00bb Sun Jan 27, 2019 12:34 pmYou shouldn't use a credit card to pay for things you can't pay for with cash.Post by dc2007 \u00bb Mon Jan 28, 2019 5:33 amI usually carry 2 credit cards with me to get the best rewards.Post by dc2007 \u00bb Mon Jan 28, 2019 2:48 pmI'm

I am considering a Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card, however, I have a credit score of 600 so I'm unsure if I will get approved.This isn't an affiliate link, but I do get paid a small commission if you use my referral code. This is the link I used to get mine (I can't guarantee you will get the same offer as I did).Also, you can check your credit score for free from Credit Karma here.I am in the 600-699 range and haven't applied for a credit card in years. I only recently opened a credit card for the first time in my adult life because I knew I needed to boost my credit score for a mortgage. I ended up getting a Chase Freedom Unlimited card, which I am really happy with! I think they have one of the better welcome bonuses available to a person with a 600 credit score. They are also very lenient with allowing you to increase your credit limit and won't check your credit score when you request a limit increase. This was an important factor for me because I wanted to use the card to increase my credit score. I haven't seen any other cards offer that option so it was a really nice plus for me!I don't know much about other cards out there. I know the Discover It card also offers a decent signup bonus. My husband has that one but I can't compare it to the Chase Freedom Unlimited because I have never used it (or had the chance to see his account!).I also don't know a lot about the best cards for people with a high interest rate because I don't know what they are.I am not trying to be a snob, but I'm really not sure what the best option would be for you. Your 600 credit score might actually be low enough that you will not be approved for the credit card I have. I would recommend checking out Credible to get a better idea of what card you might be approved for with your credit score.The Discover It card looks nice too! I'm in the 690 range and I've had the Discover card for the past 5 years. It offers a nice flat cash back rate (1-3%), no foreign transaction fees, and zero fraud liability. They are not the best in terms of welcome bonuses (I think it was a $50 bonus), but they don't do as many credit limit increases as Chase. You can check your FICO score for free here.I would go with the Capital One Quicksilver. 1.5% cash back with no foreign transaction fees and free FICO score monitoring. I think it has the best return on cash back.Thank you for the recommendation. I checked my FICO score and it is 648. It appears the Capital One Quicksilver credit card will be my next credit card. It seems to offer a great deal of benefits and I appreciate the free FICO score monitoring.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. It's a tough choice because there are a handful of great options.But in the end, I think it comes down to this: Which card's rewards program best fits your lifestyle? There's not one right answer. In fact, you may even choose to carry a couple of credit cards in your wallet to maximize earning power.That said, let's look at some of the best cards for rewards-driven consumers -- and why.Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae \u2013 Best for frequent travelersThe Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae is one of the best travel rewards cards on the market, and not just because of its 3x travel rewards rate. The 3x earning rate applies to all travel and dining purchases.And while some cards have restrictions on travel redemption dates, this one doesn't. You can use your Chase Sapphire Reserve rewards on any travel purchase. And rewards don't expire.The Chase Sapphire Reserve also offers a $300 annual travel credit that applies to any travel booked through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel center. The $300 credit is available every year.But there's more. Chase Sapphire Reserve travelers receive primary rental car insurance. You can also purchase the Chase Sapphire Reserve Premium Waiver. This is a $95 waiver that gives you access to the Centurion lounges. You can even pay for your upgrades.The Chase Sapphire Reserve also offers exclusive perks such as free hotel and restaurant reservations and a $100 application fee credit for TSA PreCheck or Global Entry.In other words, the Chase Sapphire Reserve offers incredible value. You could use your rewards to pay for travel expenses. Or you could use your annual travel credit to offset the cost of a $1,200 flight. Either way, the Chase Sapphire Reserve makes a lot of sense.Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae \u2013 Best for average travelersThe Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae is one of my favorite rewards cards because it offers 2x points on every purchase.Points are redeemable for cash. But you can also transfer your rewards to Chase's Ultimate Rewards partner airlines and hotels. Ultimate Rewards points are also redeemable for 1.25 cents each.You don't need to be an expert in travel redemption to use the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae. That's because you get $50 toward travel every year.The Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae also has a slew of other travel-related perks. You'll receive a $100 application fee credit every five years for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck.Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae also gives you a $60 hotel credit every year. That's an easy $60 in annual rewards, on top of your 2x points and $50 travel credit.The Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae also offers primary car rental insurance and access to the Centurion lounges.Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card \u2013 Best for general travelersThe Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card is a solid travel rewards card for consumers who don't want to pay an annual fee. It also offers a bonus of 40,000 miles after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first 3 months of account opening. The $95 annual fee is waived for the first year.But the Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card isn't just good for travel. It also offers great perks for general spenders.You'll receive 5 miles per dollar on purchases made at restaurants, entertainment, and at hotels. You'll also earn 2 miles per dollar on purchases made at grocery stores.You'll receive a $50 application credit every four years for TSA PreCheck. You'll also get access to a bunch of airport lounges.Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card cardholders can also redeem their rewards for airfare, which is probably the best option since this card offers 10,000 bonus miles for every redemption that results in a $300 flight.Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae \u2013 Best for cash backIf you're looking for a card that offers cash back on every purchase, I recommend the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae.This card offers a $200 annual cash bonus after you spend $1,500 in your first three months. You'll also receive 1.5% cash back on every purchase.But the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae also offers a lot of travel perks.You'll get trip cancellation and trip delay insurance. You'll also be covered for emergency medical care, emergency medical transportation, and baggage delay insurance.The Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae also offers a 12-month complimentary DoorDash membership. You'll also get free identity theft monitoring and reimbursement for certain fraudulent charges.But probably the best thing about this card is its $0 annual fee.The Amex\u00ae Gold Card \u2013 Best for diningThe Amex\u00ae Gold Card is one of the best cards for dining. You'll earn 4x points at U.S. restaurants and at U.S. supermarkets. You'll earn 3x points on flights booked directly with airlines or AmexTravel.com.You'll also receive a $100 dining credit every year. This credit is available for dining, including at restaurants and delivery apps.The Amex\u00ae Gold Card also offers other perks. You'll receive up to $100 in statement credits every year. You can also earn up to $120 in statement credits for Dell.com purchases.But there's more. You'll also get a $100 credit for Equinox + SoulCycle.If you're a frequent traveler, the Chase Sapphire Reserve is worth considering. But the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae offers a similar bonus without an annual fee.It's also good to remember that you can carry multiple cards in your wallet. In other words, you can pick your favorite rewards program and get the best of both worlds.For example, you can carry the Amex\u00ae Gold Card and the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae. The Amex\u00ae Gold Card is good for dining and entertainment purchases. The Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae is good for general purchases.But I know not everyone likes the idea of carrying multiple cards in their wallet. If you're a one-card kind of guy, I recommend the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae.I hope this helps. If you'd like more personalized advice about the best rewards card for your lifestyle, please feel free to call.The information related to Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae was independently collected by CardRates for coverage on this site.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. It's likely to depend on your individual circumstances and preferences. For example, if you want a credit card that offers cash back or rewards points for certain types of purchases, you may prefer a card from a bank or credit union.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.The American Express Platinum Card (Rates & Fees) has been around for more than 25 years and remains a great choice for travelers. It offers a welcome bonus of 50,000 Membership Rewards (MR) points after spending $4,000 in your first 3 months. While you can redeem MR points for a number of different purchases, my go-to use is airfare.I've booked a round-trip economy flight to Europe for just under $1,500 this way. I like this card because it's not tied to a single airline, as many co-branded travel credit cards are. You also get up to $200 in airline fee credits per calendar year (enrollment required), which can be applied to baggage fees, in-flight food and beverages, in-flight entertainment and more.Another key benefit of the card is the annual $200 airline fee credit. You need to enroll in the program for it to be applied, but it can cover things like checked baggage, seat selection, in-flight beverages and more.For those who'd rather spend their rewards on things other than airfare, Amex offers a handful of statement credits for things like Uber rides, TSA PreCheck and more.There is a $550 annual fee, but the value you get can make that well worth it, especially considering how much money this card can save you when it comes to air travel.Chase Sapphire Reserve (Rates & Fees) is also among the best travel credit cards available to most U.S. consumers, with its 50,000-point bonus for spending $4,000 in your first 3 months. The card is similar to the Platinum in that you can use your points to cover the cost of airfare.It also offers complimentary travel and emergency assistance services, trip cancellation and interruption insurance, and a host of statement credits that can save you money. This includes a $300 annual credit that can be used to offset the cost of travel purchases, such as hotels, airfare, trains and more. You'll also get a $100 credit each year that can be applied toward your TSA PreCheck or Global Entry membership.As far as fees go, this card also has a $550 annual fee. But the benefits you receive from these statement credits more than justify it. And if you're a frequent traveler, you can probably even earn enough from these credits to completely offset the fee.If you're willing to put in some work, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card (Rates & Fees) is a great option. It offers a welcome bonus of 50,000 miles after spending $3,000 in your first 3 months. Capital One Miles are worth 1 cent apiece toward travel purchases, so that's $500 in travel savings right out of the gate.The card also offers an annual bonus of 10,000 miles (worth $100) after spending $20,000 in the previous calendar year, and 50,000 miles (worth $500) after spending $100,000. That's 150,000 miles (worth $1,500) in rewards you can redeem for free travel.One of the best features of this card is that you can redeem your miles toward the cost of any travel purchase. So you can put your points toward an airline ticket or hotel room or even a rental car. The only limitation is that you can't redeem miles toward the cost of travel purchased directly from the travel supplier (such as Amtrak).As far as fees go, this card has no foreign transaction fees, no annual fees and no penalty APR.The Capital One\u00ae VentureOne\u00ae Rewards Credit Card is a solid option for those who don't want to pay a large annual fee, but still want to earn rewards. It offers a $100 statement credit each year for the Global Entry or TSA PreCheck fee. There is no annual fee, and Capital One has some of the best security and identity protection in the business, which can be a big deal if you're planning to travel.If you're in the market for a card with a low annual fee, Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card \u2013 18 month BT offer is a strong option. It offers 1% cash back on all purchases and an additional 1% cash back when you pay your purchases off. This is effectively a 2% cash back card, which is pretty great for a card that only charges $0 in annual fees.In addition, this card is an excellent option for those who want to earn rewards without any hassle. You don't need to choose the rewards you want to earn or spend your rewards in a specific way.Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (Rates & Fees) is an excellent card for those who want a travel rewards card without the annual fee. It offers a welcome bonus of 60,000 points after spending $4,000 in your first 3 months.This card offers 2x points for travel and dining purchases, and 1x points on everything else. That means you can earn up to 6x points on travel purchases when you book your travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards.The best feature of this card is its flexible point transfer partners. You can use your points to cover the cost of travel purchases at a 1:1 ratio.The Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card (Rates & Fees) is another excellent travel rewards card that comes with a low annual fee. It offers a welcome bonus of 20,000 points after spending $1,000 in the first 90 days of opening the account.This card offers 1.5 points for every $1 spent on travel and dining purchases, and 1 point for every $1 spent on all other purchases. That's a lot of value for a card that only charges a $0 annual fee.The only downside is that you need to redeem your points for travel purchases, which is a little more limited than other cards. However, there are still plenty of travel purchases you can make with this card.Which credit card do you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility?I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. This is a tough call, as there are a lot of factors to consider.Some people might prefer the American Express Platinum Card (Rates & Fees) because of its welcome bonus and up to $200 in airline fee credits per calendar year. Others might prefer the Chase Sapphire Reserve (Rates & Fees) because of its 50,000-point bonus and $300 in annual travel credits.The best credit card for you depends on your personal situation and travel habits. If you're a frequent traveler who uses the same airline often, the Chase Sapphire Reserve (Rates & Fees) is probably the best choice. But if you prefer to use different airlines, or are not a frequent traveler, the American Express Platinum Card (Rates & Fees) is a good choice.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. How do you determine what credit card to use for what situation?I use a number of cards. I have a couple of cards for convenience as well as a travel card that earns me miles. For purchases on the internet and over the phone I tend to use an online bank. They're good for security reasons as well as having a great interest rate.I have a small number of credit cards for different purposes. One is to earn rewards with my favorite airline, one to earn rewards in a 5% category (right now, gas), and one to earn rewards in a general category.I just keep one, that's it.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.When I'm comparing credit cards, there are a few criteria that I find to be most important.While the rewards program and sign-up bonus may be the first things you think of, these features are not important to me.I'd much rather get a card that gives me lots of perks and low interest rates. After all, you want to keep your credit card bills as low as possible.Which card do you think has the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility?My go to card is the Capital One Venture Card. They are the first company to offer unlimited rewards, 2% back on all purchases and 10% back on travel purchases made through their website. Plus, they have no annual fee, and the sign up bonus is 20k miles.I had the Chase Freedom card for the first year. I got a bonus of $125 for spending $500 within 3 months. I did receive $10 in cash back from the Freedom card in the first month. After the first year, my wife and I used the Freedom card at Sam's Club. We spent $4,000 at Sam's Club within 6 months, so we received another $100 bonus from Chase. It was a great first year!I have to admit, this was my first card. I had the same situation. Spent like $400-$500 a month, and didn't realize you couldn't get the bonus twice. I made the mistake of putting all my spending on this card, and didn't realize what a good deal I had. When I discovered I was eligible, I tried to move everything to the other two cards, but by then I'd had the card for over a year. I ended up keeping the Freedom card, but it's no longer my first choice.Which card did you finally choose?Right now I'm in the process of re-applying for the Capital One Venture Card. I've been holding off on signing up for another credit card (I already have the Chase Freedom, Sapphire Preferred and Citi ThankYou) because I didn't want to hit my credit card utilization limit. My limit was 83% last week (70% before applying for the Chase Freedom), so I'm hoping this will help lower it.I've been waiting for the Venture card to go back up to 15K miles. I was so close to getting 35K miles the other day, and I knew Capital One would put it back up.@KaseyB: Yeah, it was around $320, and I still have $314 left to pay off. After that, I'll probably have to wait another 6 months to 1 year to get another card. I was hoping I could get another Chase Freedom, but looks like that's not going to happen. I've read that I can still get the sign-up bonus on the Freedom card, but I'm not too sure about that. I did have a Chase account, so I'm not sure if they can really do that.@Jonathan: Yeah, I know. I was so close to hitting $15k, but it seems like I'm going to have to wait a while longer to get the bonus.Sounds like I should give it a try. How long did it take for them to approve you?I had the Chase Freedom card for the first year. I got a bonus of $125 for spending $500 within 3 months.

I just got the card 2 weeks ago, and it's great. I spent $500 in the first month, so I got the $100 bonus, and I received $10 cash back the first month. I was looking at the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, but I didn't realize I could get the sign up bonus again on the Freedom card. I just talked to Chase and they said I couldn't get it again. Is that true?I was really close to getting the $15k miles bonus. The only thing that stopped me was the bonus miles were good for only 2 years. I have a long time to think about it before I try to re-apply for it.I have the same situation. I have been thinking about canceling my card, since I got the Chase Sapphire Preferred. My current credit card utilization rate is 70%. What do you recommend?I have the Sapphire Preferred card, and it's my main credit card for most purchases.

I had the Sapphire Preferred card for a year, so I'm thinking about canceling it and just using the Freedom card.

When I opened the card, it was offering me 15k miles and a $50 bonus for spending $1,000 within 3 months. I just spent $1,000, and I didn't want to lose this great deal, so I put everything on my Capital One card. I spent about $2,500 in the first month, so I received the $50 bonus from Capital One.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.While my personal preference would be a cash back credit card, I am definitely not a \"traveler\". So I can understand why some people don't care about perks or low interest rates. What do you think?I use my Capital One Spark card for almost all purchases. I don't know how many of the card features I use, but it does have great perks and cash back. I love that you can spend all the cash back on anything.@Stephanie - You're right! I just looked at the fine print and found that Capital One Spark is a \"select cash back\" card. So if you don't like to travel and don't spend much on entertainment, you could probably get a lot more back from the Spark card than the AmEx Platinum, right?We have two Chase Ink cards that work great for us. We use the Ink Business Cash for 2% cash back on everything, and use the Ink Business Preferred for 3x points on everything but travel.It really depends on how you spend money. If you use travel a lot, then you should get a Chase Sapphire Reserve. If you don't, then maybe get the Amex Platinum or something like that.@Liam - I don't travel much, so that probably means I shouldn't get the AmEx Platinum. I don't think I'm really traveling enough to be able to justify it. But I guess I could always change that. Thanks!I'm all about the low interest rates. I like the Chase Freedom Unlimited the best because the interest rate is 0% for 15 months, and then after that, it's just 16.99%. So I get to pay less in interest if I pay on time.@Bill - That sounds like a great card to me! I like the sound of that 0% interest rate. Hopefully you're not carrying a balance from month to month. That would defeat the whole purpose, right?I have to admit I've never heard of a Capital One Spark card. I'll have to do some more research on that one. My AmEx Platinum card has served me well, I have to admit. It has a lot of great perks and it's good to have that 5% cash back on travel and entertainment.@Jennifer - I'm not sure how well the Spark card will serve you, if you don't travel much or have expensive entertainment. But I do like the idea of the 5% cash back! I'm pretty sure my card doesn't do that.I'm on the fence. I like the cash back option, but I'd be willing to miss out on that if I could get a low interest rate. So I guess it depends on how I do financially. Do I pay my cards off every month or do I carry a balance?I've been using a Discover card for years. They have pretty good perks and I like that I can cash out 100% of my cash back.I don't think I'd change my card now, even though I don't know much about what's out there. If I were going to, I would definitely want to see what perks and cash back I could get with the Capital One Spark, though.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. There's no shortage of options to choose from, and you may have several top picks. Here's where it gets tricky, though: Most of us don't use the same credit card for every single transaction. There are certain times we'll use our rewards credit cards to get a little bit of extra cash back, while other times we'll prefer a card with a lower interest rate to keep our debt under control.In other words, we're not looking for a \"one-size-fits-all\" credit card. We're looking for an \"optimal combination\" of financial perks.That's where credit cards with multiple rates come into play. These credit cards give you the freedom to choose which type of rate you want to apply to your purchases, and that can be a very useful option if you're carrying a lot of debt.Let's say you have an outstanding balance of $10,000 on a credit card with a 24% annual percentage rate. That means the interest alone will cost you $2,400 over the course of the year. If you're using your credit card exclusively for big-ticket purchases, it may make sense to opt for a card that charges a low APR for balance transfers, and a high APR for regular spending. That way, you can avoid paying high interest on your daily expenses, while still getting access to the benefits of a lower APR for your outstanding balance.It's important to note, though, that the best cards for everyday use won't necessarily be the best cards for balance transfers. If you're interested in moving your debt to a lower interest rate, you'll have to find the best balance transfer credit card for your needs. That said, if you don't want to use your credit card very often, you may be better off with a card that doesn't have an annual fee or an introductory period.If you're interested in exploring these options, be sure to check out our list of the best balance transfer credit cards, and our list of the best credit cards for everyday use.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.My current favorite is the United MileagePlus Explorer card, which has no annual fee and offers the opportunity to earn double miles on your first $6,000 spent. It is a Chase product, which means the ability to apply for the card and redeem the miles is a matter of convenience.The most rewarding card is the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express. The annual fee is $75 and you get a $100 statement credit each year for making one purchase at select department stores. In addition, if you have two or more people with a Blue Cash Preferred Card (and they aren't married to one another) and they both make one purchase a year at a qualifying department store, you get an additional $100 statement credit each year.I have been using the United Explorer Card and the Citi ThankYou Preferred card for a long time, and the Citi is far better, although the United offers good bonus miles, and the Citi has a good balance transfer offer.I have been using the American Express Blue Cash Preferred Card for years, and it's a good card, but I just recently changed to the Chase Freedom Unlimited Card for no annual fee, so it's great to have for people who don't spend a lot of money each year. I have two Freedom Unlimited cards, because they're for my wife and myself, but they are good cards for people who want a low-cost card that doesn't have an annual fee.The best one I have is the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card - 18 month BT offer (18 months) because I really like Citi and their rewards are unmatched, even if you do have to redeem them in the end.</s>",

But how about a credit score of less than 650?You'll still have some success getting this card, but you may have to pay an annual fee.You can't get the 20,000 mile signup bonus with a credit score below 650. But you can earn the regular bonus (10,000 miles for spending $5,000 within 3 months).Miles are worth $0.01 each, so you can expect to earn around $1,000 of value on the $5,000 you spend.I find this card an excellent deal.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I know a few people have strong opinions on the subject. I've heard about people who say that you shouldn't use credit cards at all, while others swear by them.I've been using credit cards for 20+ years and have found them to be a very useful tool. I use them all the time, as a result, and I don't really think of them as a source of debt. They just allow me to spend more money than I have on hand at any given moment.I find the idea that you can't get a credit card without a high credit score to be a ridiculous one. If that were the case, most people wouldn't be able to purchase cars, homes, and even some appliances and electronics.The other day, I went shopping at a local department store. I was approached by a credit card sales person. \"Hey,\" she said. \"I'd like to give you some credit. Is that OK with you?\" I've always hated that question because the answer is usually a \"no.\" And the people who ask are usually trying to get you to spend money on something you'll regret.I don't know if you've noticed, but the last few years have been a bit of a bumpy ride for credit card issuers. You've seen the stories about high interest rates, late fees, and increased charges for missed payments, and the general mistrust of credit cards has only grown over the last decade.A lot of people have been burned by credit cards. They're the kind of things that make you feel like you're a fool if you get them, but there are some things that are just not worth the trouble. If you find yourself in this category, you might want to rethink your relationship with credit cards. Here are the top five reasons you should avoid using them.1. It's Easy to Get ThemIt's hard to imagine why you'd ever want to have a credit card if you don't have any. They're the perfect excuse for people who want to be able to charge everything they need to buy and pay it off without paying interest or late fees.When you get a credit card, you're essentially giving yourself a loan. You get to charge up whatever you need to purchase, and then you pay off that debt when you get your next paycheck. It's like a loan, but without any consequences if you don't pay it back.That's why so many people use credit cards.

It's Easy to CancelCredit card issuers are required by law to provide you with a 30-day free trial period, which means that you can try out the credit card and cancel it within 30 days if you're not satisfied.You're not the only one who likes to try out new things. That's why so many people use credit cards. You can try out new things and cancel them if you don't like them.If you're not satisfied with the credit card you're currently using, you can cancel it any time. Just let the credit card company know that you don't want to use the credit card anymore. They'll remove it from your account and send you a new card.5. It's Easy to Pay Your BillsThere are plenty of reasons to use credit cards, and one of the most important is that they're easy to use. You don't have to carry a wallet around, which is great for people who don't like to carry around a lot of cash.And, if you don't have a lot of money to spend, you can use your credit card to pay your bills and other purchases.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. This is probably a more difficult question for someone who has never used any other cards other than the standard offerings from the major banks. I'm happy with my BMO World MasterCard for a while, at least until they stop offering 40,000 points for opening a BMO bank account.This week, I've been looking at my Tangerine savings account and was wondering if anyone else has found that Tangerine is offering a slightly higher rate than the major banks. I opened a $10,000 account at Tangerine with my TFSA and the rate was about 2.4% before they lowered the rate and then I was still in the range of 2.2%. My BMO World MasterCard offers an interest rate of 1.95%, which is a higher rate than what I'm getting with my Tangerine account.The best rate I've seen for a savings account right now from the banks are Royal Bank's at 2.25%. The catch with that account is that you can only transfer up to $5,000 per month. I was able to put over $30,000 in my account and that's why I had to start my Tangerine account with $10,000.What are your thoughts on these two options?</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.As I mentioned in my post on Credit Card Rewards, I currently use both my Discover More and Sears MasterCard for day-to-day purchases, so I'm not completely familiar with all the different options available to consumers. I've had both of my current cards for a few years now, but I've never been tempted to switch out. However, I've always been curious to see if any other credit cards offered better perks and/or a lower interest rate.My credit score is currently in the high-600s, so I probably wouldn't be able to qualify for a lot of the best rewards cards on the market. However, since I'm looking at the long-term, I'm still interested in hearing what some of the best credit cards are out there. If you have any recommendations, please share your thoughts on my Facebook page.Would you be interested in hearing about the best credit cards for those with less-than-perfect credit?</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I use the Capital One Platinum card for everyday expenses. I've also got the USAA Cash Rewards Visa (which was rebranded as the USAA Preferred Cash Rewards Visa), but it is no longer in my wallet (more on that later).Since the Capital One Platinum card has no annual fee, it is good for everyday purchases and other items that don't need an introductory 0% rate or bonus cash back.Capital One's Platinum Card has no annual fee and a solid intro APR, which makes it ideal for emergency cash needs.Why I prefer it to the Capital One Quicksilver: I don't use my credit card for everyday purchases and other types of purchases that don't qualify for the Capital One Quicksilver's bonus cash back. Instead, I prefer to use my Capital One Platinum card for those transactions and keep the Quicksilver for large purchases that I need the 0% APR for. The Capital One Quicksilver's interest rate is also a bit higher.Why I prefer it to the Capital One Spark Cash: I don't get as much in cash back from using the Spark Cash for everyday purchases and other types of purchases that don't qualify for the Capital One Quicksilver's bonus cash back.USAA Preferred Cash Rewards Visa (now known as the USAA Preferred Cash Rewards Visa): I used this card exclusively for years, but stopped using it a few years ago because I found that I couldn't take advantage of some of its benefits.Why I no longer use it: I could not use the card's 0% intro APR on balance transfers (it expired after a couple of months), and its annual fee (which is waived for the first year) made it difficult to redeem the bonus points it awards for ongoing spending.Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card: This is a 0% intro APR credit card that lets you earn cash back on all of your purchases, no matter what you spend.Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card vs. Capital One Platinum: I do not prefer the Quicksilver card over the Platinum because the cash back rate is lower on all types of purchases (excluding supermarket purchases). I also don't need the 0% APR feature since I don't use my credit card for everyday expenses and other types of purchases that don't qualify for the Capital One Quicksilver's bonus cash back.Capital One Spark Cash: This card allows you to earn 1.5% cash back on all of your purchases. It also has a 0% intro APR for a limited time.Chase Freedom Unlimited: This card offers 1.5% cash back on all of your purchases, and has a 0% intro APR for a limited time.Discover it: This card offers 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in purchases in your first quarter. It also has a 0% intro APR for a limited time.What do you prefer to use for your everyday purchases and other types of purchases that don't qualify for the Capital One Quicksilver's bonus cash back?What do you think of the Chase Freedom Unlimited's 0% intro APR offer? Do you find it to be useful?What is your favorite credit card for everyday expenses and other types of purchases that don't qualify for the Capital One Quicksilver's bonus cash back?Thanks for sharing, I think I will try out that Cash card as well as the Chase Freedom Unlimited.Hi! I just saw this article! What is your opinion of the USAA cash reward Visa? Is it worth it for the low annual fee and low interest rate?I used to use it exclusively, but I recently started using it less and less. I would say that it's definitely worth it, especially if you are a USAA member.What would you say is the best 1.5% back card?I don't know of any other cards like the Capital One Spark Cash that currently offer 1.5% cash back on all of your purchases.What's the benefit of the spark cash card vs. quicksilver card? Is it better for cash back?It depends on what you plan to use the card for. If you use it primarily for cash back, then I would recommend the Spark Cash card over the Quicksilver card.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I'm wondering because I recently received a letter from Citibank about an offer to upgrade my credit card to a new one. This is an offer from one of Citi's many cashback rewards credit cards.I read the fine print and determined that the new credit card offered 5% cashback rewards at gas stations and on airline purchases. It also offered 3% cashback rewards on purchases at supermarkets, department stores, drugstores and dining.So, how can this new offer possibly be better than my existing Citi cashback rewards credit card?The new Citi card has a lower annual percentage rate (APR) on purchases and balance transfers. That's true. But that's a pretty minor benefit for me, because I don't carry a balance on my Citi credit card and I almost never make a balance transfer.The new card also has more benefits, but I haven't looked into those yet. I don't know if they're any better than the benefits already available to me.Here's what I want to know: Is there another credit card out there that offers better benefits, better rates, and better flexibility?I don't know about you, but I've been thinking about getting another credit card anyway. That's partly because I could use the cashback rewards, and partly because a credit card is part of my overall financial strategy.I'd appreciate hearing about your experiences with credit cards and your ideas about which are the best credit cards for my personal situation.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. The last time we looked at this data was in 2012, and at that time, Capital One's card was in the lead with an impressive 12.5% overall satisfaction rating.Today, however, I've decided to take a look at the 2015 data to see if the Capital One card has continued to hold onto the top spot.Which credit card offers the best overall satisfaction?Which credit card offers the best combination of perks and benefits?Which credit card offers the best combination of low interest rates and low fees?In order to come to these conclusions, I've been collecting data on these credit cards every two years since 2007. I'm also tracking the annual interest rates, annual fees, and benefits that come with each card.To give you some background information, the first chart shows the percentage of surveyed cardholders who gave their credit cards an overall \"very satisfied\" rating.To put it simply, more cardholders are satisfied with their Capital One credit cards than any other credit card on the market.With a total satisfaction rating of 12.5%, Capital One's card is well ahead of the competition and has been the top-rated credit card for the last four years in a row.However, we haven't stopped there.Not only are Capital One credit cards ranked as the best in terms of overall satisfaction, they're also the best in terms of the benefits they offer.The next two charts highlight which credit cards offer the best benefits and which ones offer the best perks.Overall, Capital One credit cards are ranked the best in terms of the benefits they offer, followed closely by American Express.However, Capital One's card is ranked as the second-best in terms of the perks they offer. That said, there's really not much difference between the two, so either one of these cards could be considered a strong choice.When it comes to low interest rates and low fees, Capital One and Discover tied for the top spot with a satisfaction rating of 13%.That said, Capital One cardholders are a little more satisfied than Discover cardholders, and we don't have enough data to know why.What do you think? Do you agree that Capital One's card offers the best combination of low interest rates and low fees?As you can see, Capital One's card continues to be the number-one choice for people who want a high-quality credit card.The company has been doing a lot to ensure that their cardholders are satisfied, and they've managed to build the best credit card out there today.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. This is the second time I have written on the subject, and my opinion is constantly evolving as I look for new opportunities to maximize my cash-flow and earn points toward travel.In this post, I want to share my most recent credit card experiences. I'm not endorsing any particular credit card, and I hope my comments are helpful to those who are just getting started on the credit card road.If you're already an experienced credit card user and you already have a few credit cards under your belt, then you might consider my comments to be overkill. You already have an existing credit card profile, and you already know what to look for.But if you're new to this, then perhaps this post will help you in making your first big decision.The first thing to consider when you're looking at credit cards is the annual fee.Ideally, you would want to find a card that does not charge any annual fees. You should be especially leery of credit cards that charge an annual fee for the first year, since you're getting robbed of a free year.Of course, credit cards with annual fees tend to offer more valuable benefits, so your decision to pay an annual fee will be a judgment call. For example, my Chase Sapphire Preferred card is $95 per year. It's worth it to me because the annual fee is offset by the generous rewards that I receive for travel-related purchases.Annual fees range anywhere from $0 to $550.The next thing to consider is the interest rate.Ideally, you want to find a credit card with a low-interest rate, or better yet, no interest. Interest rates will often change in tandem with the prime rate, which as of this writing is 3.25%. But this can change at any time, and if you are carrying a large balance, it could be an issue.Your credit score will determine the interest rate you're offered. If you have a good credit score, then you will qualify for a low interest rate. If you have a bad credit score, then you will qualify for a higher interest rate.Interest rates range from 0% to 24%.The next thing to consider is the rewards program.Most rewards programs have a set of eligible purchases, and for each eligible purchase that you make, you earn points that you can redeem for free travel.It's important to remember that credit card companies will not always give you your full points for every dollar that you spend. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred card will give you 2 points per dollar spent at grocery stores and restaurants, but it will only give you 1 point per dollar spent on gas stations and home improvement stores.Rewards programs also have a cap on how many points you can earn for each dollar spent, so you have to be careful about how you spend your money. The best rewards program is the one that allows you to maximize your earning potential without sacrificing other benefits.Rewards programs can be confusing to sort through, so I suggest you go to a website like Award Wallet to see how much you could save with the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. The best thing about using this service is that you don't have to give your personal information, which is great if you don't want your information to fall into the wrong hands.Rewards programs usually run in tiers, where you start at a basic tier and as you spend more money you move up to a better tier that gives you better rewards.For example, if you make $50,000 per year and you spend $15,000 on gas and home improvement stores, you would get 60,000 points per year. But if you make $100,000 per year and spend $25,000 on gas and home improvement stores, you would get 100,000 points per year.Rewards tiers usually start at a lower tier and give you a basic rewards program that has a lower cap on the points you can earn. As you move up to a higher tier, your rewards program becomes more generous, and you can earn more points for every dollar that you spend.Rewards programs have annual caps on how much you can earn, so you have to be careful about how much money you spend. The more money you spend, the more points you can earn.Rewards programs range anywhere from 1 to 10 tiers.The next thing to consider is the welcome bonus.A welcome bonus is a reward that you receive for signing up for a new credit card. It usually comes in the form of a cash bonus or a points bonus.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card offers a welcome bonus of 50,000 points, which are worth $500 in travel.This bonus is one of the best reasons to sign up for the card, since the points can be used toward free travel, and there is no limit on how much you can earn.Welcome bonuses range anywhere from 10,000 points to 150,000 points.The next thing to consider is the signup bonus.A signup bonus is a reward that you receive for signing up for a new credit card. It usually comes in the form of a cash bonus or a points bonus.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card offers a signup bonus of 10,000 points, which are worth $100 in travel.This bonus is one of the best reasons to sign up for the card, since the points can be used toward free travel, and there is no limit on how much you can earn.Signup bonuses range anywhere from 2,000 points to 150,000 points.The next thing to consider is the interest rate reduction.Interest rates are typically lower on credit cards that have no annual fee, and this can be a good incentive to sign up for a new card.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card offers an interest rate reduction of 0% for the first year. This is a good reason to sign up for the card, since you will not have to worry about paying interest on your purchases.Interest rate reductions range anywhere from 0% to 24%.The next thing to consider is the foreign transaction fee.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card does not charge a foreign transaction fee. This is a good reason to sign up for the card, since you will not have to worry about paying a fee on your international purchases.Foreign transaction fees range anywhere from 3% to 5% of the total transaction amount.The next thing to consider is the purchase protection.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card offers purchase protection of $500 per claim. This is a good reason to sign up for the card, since you will be protected against theft and loss of your purchases.Purchase protection ranges anywhere from $0 to $1,000 per claim.The next thing to consider is the price protection.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card offers price protection of $500 per claim. This is a good reason to sign up for the card, since you will be protected against theft and loss of your purchases.Price protection ranges anywhere from $0 to $1,000 per claim.The next thing to consider is the extended warranty.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card offers extended warranty of 2 years. This is a good reason to sign up for the card, since you will be protected against theft and loss of your purchases.Extended warranty ranges anywhere from 0 years to 3 years.The next thing to consider is the lost luggage.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card offers lost luggage of $100 per person.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.While I appreciate the many benefits that a Chase Sapphire Preferred Card or an American Express Platinum card can offer, I feel like my Citi Prestige Credit Card gets me the most bang for my buck.Citi Prestige Credit CardSignup Bonus 50,000 miles + $250 statement credit after $4,000 in purchases within 3 months.Annual Fee $450 (waived first year)Points 3 points per dollar on travel and dining. 1 point per dollar on everything else.Introductory Interest Rate 0% APR for 15 months on balance transfers and purchasesI chose to focus on this card for several reasons. First and foremost, the Citi Prestige Card has the best signup bonus in the business. Not only do you get 50,000 airline miles after you spend $4,000 in purchases in the first 3 months, but you also get a $250 statement credit!Even if you're not a regular traveler, I find that this is an easy card to recoup the cost of. Simply apply the $250 statement credit to a $250 American Express Gift Card and you're essentially getting the card for free.If you have to pay a $450 annual fee, it's nice to know that you'll be able to recoup the fee in the first year alone. And even if you don't spend as much as I do, there's still a strong chance that you'll get the fee back.Citi Prestige has a great signup bonusIt also happens to be the only credit card in the U.S. that allows you to earn 5 points per dollar at restaurants, including both food and dining. This is a big benefit if you like to dine out for dinner or if you eat out while on the road for business.And if you spend $3,000 on travel each year, you can easily recoup the annual fee by earning the 3 points per dollar for travel.In addition to the bonus categories, Citi Prestige has some of the best benefits in the business. It's rare to see a travel card without any foreign transaction fees and this card is no different. And if you want to use your rewards for flights, it will automatically send the points to your preferred frequent flyer program.And finally, this card offers an extended warranty for 24 months and car rental insurance if you pay for the car with your Citi Prestige card.Citi Prestige offers a great signup bonus. If you have to pay an annual fee, it's nice to know that you can use it to offset the fee. And it's nice to have perks like the extended warranty and car rental insurance as a perk of using the card.What's your favorite credit card to use for travel?Related: Citi Prestige Credit Card Review: Worth it?11 Comments on \"What Credit Card Should I Use for Travel?\"Jessica | TheTravelingTurntable | July 9, 2015 at 10:14 am | ReplyI really like the Citi Prestige Card as well and agree that the signup bonus and fee waiver is a great combination!

I used to use the Amex platinum and chase Sapphire cards for this but I was charged an annual fee for the sapphire card so I switched to a citi credit card (prestige) and I love it!Jennifer | The Solitary Wanderer | July 9, 2015 at 12:10 pm | ReplyThanks! I\u2019m glad that you\u2019ve been happy with your Citi Prestige Card!

But I\u2019ve never paid an annual fee. I\u2019ve got 19 months of interest free on transfers, which I\u2019ve only used once, but it was nice knowing it was there. The points are also worth so much more than when you use them for cashback (like $2500 to $3000 if I remember correctly) so I\u2019ve always paid for travel expenses with them.I also agree about the Citi Prestige Card being a nice card for traveling and for foodies. They have a $350 statement credit if you apply by 8/21/15 so that might be worth checking out if you haven\u2019t already.Hope you have a great time at Blogfest!Jennifer | The Solitary Wanderer | July 12, 2015 at 8:21 pm | ReplyThank you so much for your comment, Kathleen!That\u2019s interesting that your Chase Sapphire Preferred doesn\u2019t offer a fee waiver and I also appreciate that you\u2019re getting the points for travel.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I've had a number of credit cards over the years and have paid down many of my balances. I'm now looking to get a new card with lower interest rates and good rewards.For the past 4 years I've paid over 1000 dollars a year in interest. I've also been paying on time for 14 years.I think the best one is the one that you pay it off every month.How do you know that you're going to be able to pay it off every month?I'm not sure what your spending habits are. There are a few variables to consider: 1) your credit limit, 2) your monthly payment plan, and 3) your annual interest rate. The card that offers the lowest interest rate and the largest credit limit should be the card that you pay off every month.I think the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility is the one that has a lower balance on it than what you can pay off each month. For example, if you have a $10,000 balance on one card and another card with a $2,000 balance that you pay off each month, then it's best to use the card with the $2,000 balance.I've never heard of such a thing, but I know that the credit card companies charge high interest rates and fees. If you want to get out of debt, I would recommend using your money to pay off as much of your credit card as possible.I think that the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility is one that gives you the ability to carry a balance for a long time without incurring penalties.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I'm currently leaning towards American Express. Their cards have no annual fees, are widely accepted, and provide a great range of perks. And the current deals they're offering make me feel I'm getting an even better deal than I had been receiving in the past.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I've seen a bunch of posts on here about credit cards, but it's a bit hard for me to decide which one to sign up for. I'm not really a huge spender (other than travel), so I'm not really sure if I need the benefits of one of the fancy-schmancy travel or cash-back cards. But at the same time, I know I'd be foolish not to sign up for a card with a low interest rate, especially since I'm planning to do lots of traveling.Any advice? Which one do you use?I have the Amex Gold card (not the premier one, which is supposed to be even better) and it's been great. It's a very low-interest card (12%) and has pretty good perks: two points per dollar spent, free rental car insurance, etc. They have a nice, simple rewards program. I don't like my cash back reward programs (I never use them and find them more confusing than the Amex one), and I haven't tried any of the travel rewards, but I'm pretty sure you could use points toward travel.I do have one complaint: the card is really hard to use for online transactions (no easy way to add it as a payment option to your PayPal account, for instance). But, I've had no problems whatsoever with Amex, so overall I'm very satisfied with the card.I've been an AMEX Platinum cardholder for years. It has been a good card for me. I get 5 points per dollar for travel (I don't travel a lot, so that's good), free rental car insurance, and 5 points per dollar for all non-travel related spending. AMEX has been very flexible about the points. I had to cancel a trip to Paris because of a family death, and they were great about giving me the points back. They also had a good point/mileage exchange program with United. I can't get in to the current one because the points have changed but it was a good program.My only complaint is the high interest rate (21.99%).I've recently decided to switch to a travel card. I think I'm going to get the Discover Miles card. It's similar to AmEx in that it's a points system that you can redeem for travel, but you can also redeem the points as cash. The sign-up bonus is $500 which is pretty cool.The biggest issue I've had with AMEX is the lack of an online account.Anyway, I think I'll go for the Chase Sapphire Preferred Rewards Visa card. It seems like it has a decent sign-up bonus and it offers a $50 statement credit for using Chase's Uber service.Oh, yeah...it's really expensive. They have one of the highest interest rates in the business.Sorry if this is a repeat...I've been trying to sign up for a new credit card for quite a while, and I finally decided to go with the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. It seems to have some decent perks (points for travel, cash-back on certain types of transactions, no foreign transaction fees), as well as a nice sign-up bonus and 0% interest for 12 months. The annual fee is $95, but it comes with an $80 credit, so it's only $15 for the first year. I just have to get through the application process without making any mistakes, and I should be all set.I'm still a little iffy about it, though, since I don't really spend a lot of money (I have a Chase debit card which gives me 5% cash-back on a lot of stuff). But at the same time, I figure I might as well get the benefits of a low-interest credit card with some extra perks.Anyone here use this card or have any advice for a newbie?</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I've listed a few below, but please feel free to add more in the comments!As always, it's best to shop around before choosing your credit card.Chase Sapphire Preferred: 0% APR for 12 months and 2 points per $1 spent on travel and diningChase Ink: 0% APR for 12 months and up to 50,000 pointsUS Bank Platinum: 0% APR for 12 months and low interest rates (but no points or perks)I'm not much of a credit card guy, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. I'd also be interested to hear which credit cards you all are using, and why.I agree with the choices. We have been trying to make our first trip abroad for years. We want to travel and not pay $600 for hotel and flight for just a couple of days. I would love to hear about your trip to the Philippines. I've been there and love the people there and would love to return to see some other places. If you can, email me.Glad to hear you've had such a positive experience with the Sapphire Preferred Card! I recently opened the account and I've only had one or two charges so far, but everything looks good so far.Here's some of the perks that I'm looking forward to:1) No foreign transaction fees on international purchases. This alone is enough for me to not want to carry a debit card on vacation.2) I'll probably do some spending on Amazon and other online retailers, and it'll be nice to get the 2x points on those purchases.3) 0% interest for 12 months on all purchases.4) 15,000 bonus points if you charge $1000 in the first 3 months (and meet some other criteria).5) 50,000 bonus points if you apply with a travel buddy. This one probably won't apply for me, but I'll be sure to post here if it does :)6) Free two-day shipping on Amazon if you buy their $70 gift certificate. You get the card, they send you a code, you use the code, you get your stuff, and you get to keep the card. Win-win.7) Free credit score reports every month.Hope you have some good experiences with your travels. Feel free to email me at chris at gocurrycracker dot comI'm a big fan of the Ink Cash Business card. It's a little bit different than the Ink Plus in that it offers up to 50k bonus points ($500 worth) instead of the Ink Plus' $600.The Ink Cash card is a business card, but I like to think of myself as a business. I use my rewards for business expenses. The $500 in cash bonus points makes the Ink Cash card one of the top cash back cards for business owners. You could also use the card for personal expenses, in which case, the Plus would be better.The Ink Cash card offers an introductory 0% rate for 12 months. You'll have to meet the minimum monthly requirements for purchases and payments, but it's good to know you can go 12 months interest-free.The Ink Cash offers 5% cash back on purchases at office supply stores, cell phone/phone services, landline communications, and on internet, cable, and satellite services.Overall, this is a great card that offers big rewards to small business owners. You can sign up here: http://tinyurl.com/cashinkThe main reason I wanted to share this is because I think a lot of people are afraid of going into business for themselves, or are intimidated by it. But there are so many small business owners out there, including yourself. I know I'm not the only person who is starting his own business and doing his own thing. I think it's a great way to gain financial freedom.I think a lot of people just don't realize it's possible. The other thing is that people think you have to have a storefront or office, but that's not the case. You can do a lot of business online and never set foot in an office. The other thing that I've seen so many people do is quit their jobs and work on their business.I love the idea of someone who quits their job and works on their business, especially because they're working on their passion, which I think is so important. I also think it's important to focus on your passion instead of your job. There are so many people who are unhappy because they're not following their passions. They're not doing what they love. I think that's a really big reason why so many people are unhappy with their jobs.You can learn more about me and my business at http://www.currycracker.com.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. What are your thoughts?This depends a lot on the credit profile. For someone with good credit (i.e. they have been a responsible borrower for some time) a card with no annual fee and a lower interest rate may make the most sense. There may be times where you need some flexibility on your monthly payment, or you want to be able to transfer a balance to a different card without any penalties. In these cases, a card with a low introductory rate may work best.For someone that doesn't have an excellent credit history (i.e. there are a few blemishes on their report) I would always recommend they start with a rewards card. It's not as important whether they have an introductory rate, as the real focus should be on the rewards. I have clients that only keep one card, and they use that card for everything. That way, they can maximize their rewards points and avoid being charged interest.Of course, for the vast majority of the population there is probably no \"best card.\" That's because most people have limited experience with their credit and/or have a lot of debt (which means they may not even qualify for a credit card with the best perks). Instead, I'd recommend looking at what makes the most sense for your financial situation. If you need to keep your payment low, then I'd focus on the introductory offers. If you want flexibility, then I'd find a credit card with a lower interest rate.But, for most people it doesn't matter because they probably should be using debit cards or cash instead.I don't have a favorite card, but I'll use them for rewards and the bonus rewards categories like 2x gas at supermarket, or 1x everywhere else.I do like the no foreign transaction fee. It is very useful when traveling abroad.This question always comes up and it's so hard to give a definitive answer, especially since the perks vary depending on which card you get.For the average user, the most important thing is to look at how you intend to use your card. If it's to accumulate rewards points, then there are lots of cards out there with decent rewards. Some even give rewards on purchases that aren't the card's rewards category. The best rewards cards also tend to come with a nice annual fee, so look for a card that has a strong rewards category.If you're looking for the best card overall, then I'd look at cashback cards. They typically come with lower fees and can pay up to 5% cashback in certain categories.What I would look for in a card is the lowest possible APR and low fees. If your credit is strong enough, you can get that with most of the credit cards offered in the U.S.There are many different factors that determine whether or not you should have a credit card. You can read about them here and determine what is right for you.But, if I had to choose the best credit card for most people, I'd say it's the one with the lowest APR.</s>",

It offers 5X Membership Rewards points per $1 spent on flights and prepaid hotels booked with American Express Travel, 5X Membership Rewards points per $1 spent on hotels booked through AmEx Travel, 1.5X Membership Rewards points per $1 spent on purchases in select business categories, and 1X Membership Rewards point per $1 spent on all other purchases.The AmEx Platinum Card also offers $200 in airline fee credits that can be applied toward baggage fees or other services, a $100 Uber credit each year, and a $100 annual Saks Fifth Avenue shopping credit. Plus, it has no foreign transaction fees.The card also offers a 0% introductory APR on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months from the date of your first purchase, and an APR of 17.49% to 25.99% thereafter. It has an annual fee of $550, which is waived in the first year. You can see the Platinum Card's full details here.This card also allows you to transfer your rewards to a travel partner.The AmEx Platinum card also has a unique travel benefit called the $200 hotel credit that gives you a $200 annual statement credit toward purchases at eligible hotel properties when you pay for your stay with your AmEx Platinum card. This benefit works at participating hotels in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East.This benefit gives you one credit of up to $200 each year you spend at least $10,000 on qualifying stays (with eligible purchases at $7,500 and $15,000 earning a $150 and $200 statement credit).I think that the Chase Sapphire Reserve, the American Express Platinum Card, and the American Express Gold Card are the best cards for travel, although the American Express Gold Card is the cheapest.These cards also have the best perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility, in my opinion.But you might prefer the Capital One Venture card, which offers 2 miles per $1 spent on every purchase, no annual fee, and 50,000 miles (equal to $500) after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months.</s>",

I just got that on the Citi AA card.I just cancelled my Citi AA card as of today. I\u2019m going to switch to the Barclays card. I also got a 25k bonus from Citi AA and a $250 airfare credit.I have the Citi AAdvantage World Elite MasterCard and don\u2019t have any problems with it. I also have the Capital One Quicksilver card. I think the Quicksilver is the best cash back credit card because you get 1.5% back on every purchase.The Quicksilver has been great, but I think my Chase Sapphire Preferred has been better.My wife has the Citi card, and I have the Quicksilver. We just got the 25k bonus on the Citi card.Glen | July 27, 2010 at 11:28 pm | ReplyI\u2019ve got the Chase Ink card (Cash Rewards). No foreign transaction fees, and 5% cashback on certain purchases.I had the Sapphire but had to return it after they denied a fraudulent purchase that I had nothing to do with. I don\u2019t trust Chase anymore.Liam | July 27, 2010 at 11:32 pm | ReplyI have an old Bank One card. I keep it for the no foreign transaction fee and cashback.I had the Chase Sapphire, but they charged me too much of an interest rate, so I switched to a Barclaycard.Jon | July 28, 2010 at 9:59 am | ReplyI got a 25K bonus on the citi card, but I canceled it because I didn\u2019t want to wait to get a new card with the 25K bonus. I think the Chase Sapphire card is the best card in terms of points, but I want to stay with the Barclays card because of the 10,000 free miles. I can still do a 25K bonus on the Barclays card, but I can\u2019t do a 25K bonus on the Chase card.I think the Chase Sapphire Preferred is the best. I don\u2019t like the no foreign transaction fee cards. They aren\u2019t as good for me since I travel a lot to other countries.I got the Citi AAdvantage card because it had the 25,000 miles.

I\u2019ve gotten it 3 times in the past 2 years.I have 2 Citibank cards, the Citi ThankYou Preferred and the Citi Forward card. I really like them both and I think that they are both excellent cards.I think the best overall is the Chase Sapphire Preferred because it gives the most benefits overall.I don\u2019t have a credit card with a 25k bonus, but I got the Chase Sapphire card because it is the best for travelers.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. Here are the cards I would recommend to anyone that I think are the best of the best.The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is one of my favorite cards to recommend to beginners, especially those who want to earn lots of travel points. Chase offers some of the best travel rewards around with this card. I would recommend this card to someone just starting out who wants to start saving on travel. You'll earn 2X points on dining and travel and 1 point per dollar on everything else. That sounds good, right? Well, it gets even better. You can transfer those rewards to 10+ different airline and hotel partners. You can also redeem them for cash at a 1:1 rate or through Pay Yourself Back at a 1.25 cents value.This card offers tons of travel benefits too. You'll get a $50 statement credit every 4 years for travel purchases, a $60 annual travel credit, and even a $100 Global Entry or TSA Pre-Check credit. If that wasn't enough, you'll get complimentary rental car insurance, primary rental car insurance, and lost luggage coverage. Plus, you'll get Priority Pass Select membership, which offers free airport lounge access.Best for: Those who are just starting out.Annual Fee: $0 for the first year, then $95 afterThis is a great card to start building your credit if you are a young student or just starting out. If you have a student loan and you're looking to build credit, you'll benefit from this card's $0 annual fee and low APR. That's not all. You'll earn 1X point per dollar spent, which can be redeemed for cash back or transferred to a Chase Sapphire card, where the value increases to 1.25 cents. This is a great starter card that will help you build your credit while earning some money on the side.Best for: Students looking to build credit.I think the Amex EveryDay Card from American Express is a great option for those who want to earn 1X point per dollar spent. However, if you're a heavy dining or travel spender, you can't go wrong with this card either. You'll earn 2X points on up to $6,000 in spending per year on dining and travel. That's $12,000 total spent on those categories, meaning you could earn 48,000 Amex points. After that, you'll earn 1 point per dollar spent. You can transfer those points to 14+ different airline and hotel partners, or redeem them for cash at a 1:1 value. You'll also get $100 statement credit each calendar year at US Supermarkets for purchases of $1,000 or more. That's on top of the $120 in annual dining and travel credits you'll get. Plus, you'll get complimentary lounge access, lost luggage insurance, and baggage delay insurance.If you're interested in a no-annual-fee travel rewards credit card, then this is the one you should apply for. You'll earn 2X points on purchases at gas stations and restaurants (up to $1,000 in spending per month) and 1 point per dollar spent on everything else. You can redeem those points for travel through Chase's travel portal. You can also transfer them to 10+ different travel partners.

Plus, you'll get Priority Pass Select membership, which offers free airport lounge access.Best for: Those looking to build travel points in a no-annual-fee card.This card offers lots of value for a low annual fee of $0. It's an excellent card for those who want to earn points quickly. With it, you'll earn 1.5X points per dollar spent on all purchases. You can redeem those points for cash, but they're really valuable when redeemed for travel. It is important to note that this card offers 0% APR for 15 months from account opening, then a 14.99%, 20.99%, or 24.99% (variable) APR.Best for: People looking for a 0% APR credit card to help them pay off their purchases.The Citi Premier Card is a great no-annual-fee card to have in your wallet. If you're a foodie, you'll like earning 3X points on dining. You can also earn 3X points on travel and gas and 2X points on groceries. If you have no interest in those categories, then you can simply earn 1X point per dollar spent. That's the same as the Chase Freedom Flex card.You'll earn 60,000 points after you spend $4,000 in the first 6 months. That's worth $750, according to our valuations. This is a great bonus offer for a no-annual-fee card. You can redeem those points for cash, but they're better when you redeem them for travel through Citi's travel portal. You can also transfer them to several different airline and hotel partners. You'll get a $100 statement credit every calendar year on travel purchases.Best for: People who don't want to pay an annual fee and still earn lots of rewards.Annual Fee: $0 for the first year, then $95The United Quest card offers the best bonus and ongoing rewards of any airline credit card.

Or would you just go for the best interest rate and pay it off each month?You say you want a \"flexible\" credit card?As you can see I have 3 credit cards and they all are used for different purposes.I think having a variety of credit cards can be advantageous to someone, particularly someone who doesn't pay interest and therefore isn't limited in their ability to use a credit card.I would personally go for the lowest possible interest rate credit card with no annual fee (like the Tangerine Moneyback Visa). And I would only get one card, not a dozen. I have found that I can manage my finances better when I only have one credit card.I like having the option of using one of my cards (or even all 3) when I'm in a pinch. If I ever needed to use a card for something urgent, I like knowing that I have a credit card to use.If you want to have flexibility with your credit cards, then I think the only option you have is to get a variety of cards and not just one.I have 3 credit cards. They are all \"flexible\".The Visa from Citi. The card is the one I carry around and use for most of my transactions. The cash back rewards are awesome. The interest rate is decent, and the card has a few useful perks. However, they are now charging an annual fee for the card. So, in terms of fees, this card has gone up.My second card is the BMO Mastercard. The cash back rewards aren't as great, but the card is accepted everywhere in the world. I like that I can use this card for emergency purposes. I also like that I have a \"world\" card. I don't use the card for everyday expenses because I don't travel that much and the cash back reward isn't as good as my other card.My third card is the PC Financial Visa card. This is a really old credit card. I have it because I've been with the company for a long time. This is my \"backup\" card. I don't use it for day to day transactions because I have a lot of other cards. I like that I can earn a point per $2 that I spend. The points are kind of useless though since I only ever spend money at PC Financial.

I think it makes it easier to budget my money.I use 3 credit cards and they are all useful for different reasons.The first is an Amex card that I've had for a very long time. It's been a revolving line of credit for a long time now, but I still use it for large purchases. It is the card that I use the most and will be paying off in the next couple of months.My second card is from the Royal Bank of Canada. This is a no annual fee credit card that has no interest at all and has the benefit of being accepted anywhere Visa is accepted. It is the card that I use for things like my phone bill, online purchases, and to pay my RRSP contributions.My third card is from the HSBC Bank. I've had this one for a little over a year. It's an interest-free credit card that is not very useful. I don't use it as often, and it isn't as useful as the other two cards I have.I think it is useful to have a variety of credit cards that you can use for different purposes. I don't have any other cards in addition to these three, but I'm considering getting another one. I don't know which one I'll end up getting, but I'm thinking of getting a no annual fee credit card to use for small purchases.I'm a bit hesitant to have a new card with a low interest rate and cash back.I'm thinking about getting the Tangerine Moneyback Visa because of their cash back rewards program.

Or would you just have the one credit card with the best interest rate and pay it off each month?I currently have a no annual fee credit card from the RBC and it's been very useful.

This card is a low interest rate card that does not have any rewards. It is a card that I use for my everyday purchases.I would personally go for the lowest possible interest rate credit card with no annual fee (like the Tangerine Moneyback Visa).

My parents and I were able to get a $50 cash back bonus and a $200 cash back bonus on separate credit cards, so that was pretty awesome! I'm happy with the credit card I have and I wouldn't want to change it. I do think that Chase Sapphire Preferred is a great card too, however.Discover has been pretty good to me so far, I haven't been using it that long yet, but I don't see a reason to change. I like their website as well, it's pretty simple to get around and to find what you are looking for.I've been very pleased with my Bank of America credit card. I have one that offers rewards on my gas purchases and another that offers a cash back bonus. I recently got a new job and am planning on getting a second credit card soon that will offer more rewards.I'm currently considering the Chase Sapphire Preferred, I've heard many great things about it. It looks like it has many of the same perks as Discover, but I'm concerned about their credit limit. It's not a huge thing to me because I make a ton of money and I have a lot of credit, but I don't want to make a new account that will make it hard for me to get more money in the future.I think Discover is a great card for rewards, it has no annual fees and it gives you cash back on your purchases. I also like how Discover doesn't require a high credit score.I have had a Capital One Cash Rewards card for several years now and have been very happy with it. The rewards they offer on my credit card are incredible and their customer service is amazing.I am considering switching to a Chase Sapphire card.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.A friend of mine recently purchased a new laptop computer. The salesman told him that the 21-inch LCD screen would last him a lifetime. My friend was skeptical about the salesman's claim, so he asked him for a 90-day money back guarantee. The salesman looked at my friend in shock. \"Why do you want a money back guarantee? This is a 21-inch LCD screen. I promise it will last you a lifetime.\"My friend's response: \"But the salesman's promise doesn't last a lifetime. And you don't know that this isn't a defective screen. If you gave me a lifetime guarantee, then I'd have peace of mind.\"While a money back guarantee isn't something you want to abuse, it's nice to have one when you're considering purchasing big-ticket items. It's also nice to have the option to walk away from your financial commitments.Credit card issuers have realized this. Now, they are willing to issue credit cards that have no annual fee, a 0 percent introductory interest rate, a money back guarantee, and the ability to \"walk away\" from your financial commitment.Today's card issuers offer two types of cards - reward cards and cash back cards. A reward card typically gives you cash rewards when you spend money. The cash can then be used towards anything you choose (gas, travel, clothing, etc.). A cash back card gives you money back when you spend money. This money is then deposited into your credit card account.The rewards and cash back cards are both excellent options, but each has distinct advantages and disadvantages. If you have been wondering whether a reward or cash back card is better, this article will help you decide.The Cash Back CardA cash back card works by giving you a percentage of what you spend. For example, if you spend $1,000 per year, you will receive $100 back from the issuer. This money is then deposited into your credit card account. You then use this money towards any purchases you choose to make. For example, you can use it towards your monthly cable bill, groceries, or even your mortgage payment.The advantage of a cash back card is that it can provide financial flexibility to consumers. It provides a type of \"float\" money that you can use towards any of your financial commitments. In essence, this is free money for you to use towards anything you choose.The drawback is that this free money comes at a price. Cash back cards are known for charging higher than average interest rates (18 percent or more). The interest rates are usually charged to your account every month regardless of whether or not you make a purchase.The reward card is a newer option on the scene. This card works by giving you cash when you make a purchase. In the old days, issuers would give you airline miles when you spent money. Now, they will give you cash, and they'll use a wide variety of marketing gimmicks to convince you to spend more.The advantage of a reward card is that it allows you to use your cash to purchase anything you choose. You can use your cash to pay for travel expenses, clothes, or even your mortgage payment. The biggest benefit, though, is the fact that you can get free cash. Rewards cards give you cash back and they are excellent options for consumers who can't resist spending money.The disadvantage is that you can only use your cash towards things you choose. If you spend too much money on clothes or dining out, then you might find that you're not left with as much cash for the things you need. This can result in financial stress and debt, which is why these cards are only recommended for consumers who can resist overspending.The Best Credit Cards: Which Card is Best?The bottom line is that both types of cards are great options. It all depends on the type of cardholder you are. If you are someone who can control your spending and is looking for financial flexibility, then a cash back card is probably the best choice. If you are a type of person who cannot control their spending and is in search of a cash \"float,\" then a cash reward card is probably the best choice.Anthony Nieves is a credit expert who has been writing about personal finance and debt for over a decade.

Many credit cards offer a 0% rate on balance transfers, while others charge very high cash advance rates.3.

Many people use credit cards for a variety of reasons, including building credit, earning rewards, and saving money. Some people use credit cards to pay for items they cannot afford with cash.

The amount of the deposit varies, but is usually equal to the card's maximum spending limit. Secured credit cards are generally used to build credit and improve your FICO score. Unsecured credit cards are not secured with a deposit and do not require an application. These cards are typically used for everyday purchases and do not offer rewards or cash back. Prepaid credit cards are similar to debit cards, but you must load money onto the card in order to use it. Prepaid credit cards do not require an application and are typically used for travel and other expenses.Which credit card is right for you?There are many different types of credit cards available, and each has its own set of benefits and drawbacks. The best way to decide which credit card is right for you is to compare the benefits of each type of card and choose the one that best meets your needs.If you're looking for a low-interest rate, then a secured credit card may be the best option for you. If you're looking for a rewards program, then an unsecured credit card may be a better fit. And if you're looking for a card with no annual fee, then a prepaid credit card may be the best choice for you.No matter which type of credit card you choose, make sure to compare the fees and benefits of each before making your decision.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.It is very important to me to have a credit card with a low interest rate. I have paid down the balance on my current card (a Discover) and I don't plan on using it again.I would use it to buy things for my business, which is why I want a lower interest rate.If there is a card out there with a great combination of low rate, high limit, great customer service, and perks, I'd like to know about it.I do not have a Discover card, but it sounds like I should consider one.The Chase Freedom card is my favorite card. I get 1% back on all purchases, and 5% on rotating categories (up to $1500 each quarter). Plus it offers $100 cash back for new card members (they'll match your highest sign-up bonus in the past 18 months with other cards).This is probably my all-around favorite card. I also have a Chase card that earns me 2% on gas and dining (but 1% elsewhere).I would recommend you check out www.cardhub.com to see all the cards out there.I have an American Express Blue Cash card, and I like it very much. The card has no annual fee and pays 3% cash back on grocery and drugstore purchases.It has a $25 annual fee for $2500 in annual spending.This is the card I use for all of my personal and business expenses. I get a 1% bonus on my spending, and if I spend more than $10,000, the 1% bonus goes to 2% (and it is 5% on gas stations).I also have a Bank of America business card that pays 1% for purchases, and a Discover card.I will take a look at Card Hub.I also like the Discover card.Thanks for the tip about CardHub, Jody! It's a great tool for comparing different cards and their perks.The American Express Blue Cash card is another card I would like to apply for. It is my favorite of the Blue Cash cards, because it is a cash card (not a points card) and it has a low annual fee.The one thing that makes the Amex Blue Cash card stand out from other cards with lower annual fees is that you get a free monthly report on your credit score, as well as free copies of your credit reports (with your credit score included) once a year.Thanks for posting this, Jody. I agree that Card Hub is a good resource for comparing different cards and their benefits.I also use this site a lot, it's great for comparing rewards cards and figuring out which is best for you based on spending habits, etc.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I use the American Express Platinum card for almost all of my spending, except for the 2% rewards cards I have for my gas purchases and for Whole Foods purchases. My AMEX card has a $450 annual fee, and I don't qualify for a rewards card that offers rewards for my everyday purchases. I love my AMEX card because it's a great card for business travelers; I get 5X rewards on airfare and 10X rewards on hotels booked on the AMEX website, as well as other great perks such as a $100 airline credit, and a $100 hotel credit. Additionally, the card's annual fee is rebated the second year, so I only pay $350. That's a great deal to me for the perks I receive.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.So, please answer one simple question:If you could only have one credit card, what would it be and why?I would choose the Chase Sapphire Preferred card for my choice of one card. It's not the best in terms of bonus miles, but it is the best one to use as your everyday card. The cash back is 2% back on dining and travel expenses, and the rewards you earn can be used on anything. I use it as my everyday card and save on travel.For a long time, I thought about using the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card for that reason as well. However, my experience with the Chase Freedom Unlimited card has been a much more positive one.While the Chase Freedom Unlimited card doesn't have a travel bonus like the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, it does have a 1.5% cash back bonus on all purchases.Plus, it doesn't have an annual fee like the Chase Sapphire Preferred card.So, to answer your question, I'm going to choose the Chase Freedom Unlimited card as my one and only credit card.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I'm not an expert in this area, so I was wondering what kind of help and advice you guys could offer. I really need a credit card that will allow me to pay my bills with some money to spare. I'm looking for a credit card that will give me some extra spending power.Sounds like the best credit card for your situation is the Chase Sapphire Preferred.This is the best card for someone who wants a flexible card to use for everything but airline and hotel booking. The Chase Sapphire Preferred has a 1:1 points ratio on all spending and no cap on the amount of points you can earn. Plus, if you want, you can upgrade to the Sapphire Reserve card and earn 100,000 bonus points after $4,000 spend in the first three months. The Reserve card also comes with a $300 annual travel credit, which is a nice perk if you travel a lot.You will also earn 5x points on travel and dining purchases with the Sapphire Preferred card, which is perfect if you're a frequent traveler. I personally love the Chase Sapphire Preferred and use it for everyday purchases and even use it for international purchases (as long as I have enough points). Plus, the annual fee is only $95.If you don't mind paying an annual fee, I would suggest the Chase Sapphire Reserve as your primary card.In fact, the Sapphire Preferred card is my top pick for a primary credit card as well. It has a great rewards rate, a ton of flexibility, and even has travel credits to offset the $95 annual fee. It's also nice that you can get a bonus of 50,000 points for meeting the minimum spending requirement.Another solid option that I would recommend is the Capital One Venture Rewards card.This card is perfect if you travel for business or pleasure and want to earn 2x miles on all purchases. The Venture card also comes with a signup bonus of 50,000 miles after spending $3,000 in the first three months. You'll also earn 5x miles on hotel and car rental purchases, which makes it an even more valuable rewards card.The Capital One Venture Rewards card also comes with a $95 annual fee, but you can offset this fee by redeeming your miles for flights. You'll typically get 1 cent per mile in value when redeeming your miles for travel, which makes this card even more lucrative than the Sapphire Preferred.I'd recommend getting the Sapphire Preferred or the Venture Rewards card as your primary card for everyday spending. You can always pair these cards with the Sapphire Reserve card to maximize your points earning potential. The Reserve card has a $450 annual fee, but you'll earn 100,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 in the first three months. Plus, you'll earn 3x points on travel and dining purchases, which makes it ideal if you spend a lot on these types of expenses.Which Credit Card Offers The Best Cashback Rewards For Everyday Purchases?My Best Cashback Credit CardIf you want the best cashback credit card, I'd recommend the Chase Freedom Unlimited.This card offers a 1.5% cashback rate on all purchases, which is one of the highest rates out there. Plus, the card has no annual fee and you can earn a signup bonus of $200 if you spend $500 in the first three months. The Chase Freedom Unlimited is a great card for everyday spending and it's also a great card to pair with the Sapphire Preferred or Reserve cards.The Capital One Savor Cash Rewards card is another great option if you want a cashback credit card. This card offers a 2% cashback rate on all purchases, which is one of the highest rates on the market. Plus, you'll earn a signup bonus of $200 if you spend $500 in the first three months. This is a great card for everyday spending and it's also a great card to pair with the Sapphire Preferred or Reserve cards.In terms of everyday cashback, I would say that the Chase Freedom Unlimited and Capital One Savor Cash Rewards cards are both great options.The Freedom Unlimited offers a higher cashback rate than the Savor Cash Rewards card, but it does have an annual fee of $0 (which you can offset by redeeming your rewards for cash). The Savor Cash Rewards card does not have an annual fee, but it does have a lower cashback rate than the Freedom Unlimited card.What Is The Best Credit Card For Someone With Excellent Credit?I'm going to recommend the American Express\u00ae Gold Card as the best credit card for someone with excellent credit.This card has no annual fee and you can earn a signup bonus of 50,000 points after spending $2,000 in the first three months. The Gold card offers a 4x points earning rate on dining purchases and 4x points earning rate on travel purchases. Plus, you'll earn 3x points on all other purchases. This makes it a great card for someone who wants to maximize their rewards on everyday spending.The Gold card also has a great perk in that it offers complimentary access to The Hotel Collection, which gives you free breakfast for two when you stay at a participating hotel. This is a great benefit if you travel often and it's another reason why this is a great credit card for someone with excellent credit.You should use the American Express\u00ae Gold Card for everyday spending if you want to earn a lot of points on dining and travel purchases. The signup bonus is also great if you want to earn a lot of points quickly.What Is The Best Credit Card For Someone With Bad Credit?The best credit card for someone with bad credit is the Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card.This card has no annual fee and you can earn a signup bonus of $50 if you spend $150 in the first three months. The card also has a low interest rate and no balance transfer fee. This is a great option if you need a credit card but have bad credit.Another good option if you have bad credit is the Capital One Platinum Credit Card.This card has no annual fee and you can earn a signup bonus of $200 if you spend $500 in the first three months. The Capital One Platinum card also has a low interest rate and no balance transfer fee.While the Capital One Platinum card does not have as many perks as the Discover it\u00ae Secured card, it is still a great option if you have bad credit. The low interest rate is especially helpful if you carry a balance from month to month.The Discover it\u00ae Secured and Capital One Platinum cards are both great options if you need a credit card but have bad credit.I've been searching for a rewards credit card that has no annual fee and allows me to earn a signup bonus. I came across the Capital One Platinum and Chase Freedom Unlimited cards, both of which have no annual fees and offer signup bonuses of $200 and $150, respectively.I'm curious to know which card you think is the better choice.The Capital One Platinum card has a higher signup bonus than the Chase Freedom Unlimited card, but it does have an annual fee of $0 (which you can offset by redeeming your rewards for cash). The Chase Freedom Unlimited card does not have an annual fee, but it does have a lower signup bonus than the Platinum card.The Platinum card is a good choice if you want to earn a lot of points on everyday purchases. The Chase Freedom Unlimited card is a good choice if you want a card with no annual fee and want to earn points on everyday purchases.Which Credit Card Offers The Best Travel Benefits?The best credit card for travel benefits is the Chase Sapphire Reserve.This card offers a 1:1 points ratio on all spending, a $300 annual travel credit, and a free yearly membership to Priority Pass Select (which gives you access to over 1,000 airport lounges worldwide).The Reserve card is also a great option if you're looking for a card that has no foreign transaction fees. Plus, the card offers a 3x points earning rate on travel and dining purchases.The Reserve card is the best credit card for travel benefits if you want to earn a lot of points on everyday spending and don't mind paying an annual fee.The Sapphire Reserve card is a great option if you're looking for a credit card with no annual fee and want to earn points on everyday spending.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I would say the Chase Sapphire Preferred.For starters, the 25,000 point signup bonus is amazing. While there's no direct cash back like there is with the Discover More or AmEx Everyday Preferred, they can be transferred to any of a number of airlines or hotels and then used for travel.Also, the points are great for those who travel. There's an option to redeem points for travel at 1:1 ratio, but you also have the option to upgrade to an option that gets you 25% more for travel expenses. That's a 10.75% cash back.There is no annual fee. There is also no limit to how much you can transfer points between cards.The Chase Freedom is a good alternative.Discuss: Which credit card is best?</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.This is an interesting topic to me. I feel that the best credit card for you is the one that has no interest rate. Why? Well, if you are disciplined, you can avoid ever incurring any interest charges. The best way to accomplish this is to pay your balance in full at the end of each month.Another way to keep interest low is to pay your balance down and pay no interest at all.If you pay only the minimum payment, you'll pay a lot more in interest. But if you pay down your balance, you'll save a lot of money in the long run.I'm going to go ahead and say that a good credit card is one that has a low interest rate, but doesn't offer a lot of perks.The best credit cards offer a good balance transfer offer and a low interest rate. However, they also offer a low interest rate, which is better than nothing.There are a few credit cards that I would recommend, though, for your consideration. One of them is the Capital One Quicksilver.Capital One Quicksilver is one of the few cards that doesn't have a $0 annual fee, and it has a pretty good balance transfer offer. But it's not the only one.American Express offers a number of cards with no annual fee, and there are a few other cards that have a $0 annual fee. But they're all pretty good credit cards.One thing to keep in mind with the Capital One Quicksilver is that it has a high interest rate. It has a pretty good balance transfer offer, but it's not the best.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I also would like to know if the credit card you carry now is different from the one you carried in the past.I'm always interested to hear why people choose to carry specific credit cards, so share your thoughts.1. What is the name of the credit card you currently carry?2. Which credit card did you carry in the past?1. Chase Freedom Unlimited (current).2. Chase Sapphire Preferred (past).3. Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa (past).2. Capital One Quicksilver Rewards Credit Card.I have the Citi Double Cash Card, which has a great 2% cashback structure, no annual fee, and is very easy to understand.What I love about it is that it's simple and straight-forward. It doesn't try to be too fancy, or have complicated reward structures. It's just a great no-hassle cashback card, and I really like it.The Double Cash Card offers 1% back on all purchases and an additional 1% back when you pay your balance in full (so, 2% back total). It also offers 0% APR for 18 months for balance transfers and purchases.It seems to offer an overall good value, and that's why I really like it. It doesn't have complicated rewards structures or point balances.When I first started carrying credit cards, I carried the Chase Freedom card, which offers 5% cashback on rotating categories of spending. I love the fact that I earned 5% back on my dining spending, and it made going out to eat with friends much more affordable.However, I recently switched to the Chase Sapphire Preferred, which has a $95 annual fee, but offers many more perks than the Chase Freedom.For example, the Sapphire Preferred card offers a 60,000 point signup bonus, which can be used to book travel (thanks to Chase's Ultimate Rewards program), but the Chase Freedom only offered a 10,000 point signup bonus.The Sapphire Preferred card offers 2x points on all travel and dining spending, whereas the Chase Freedom only offered 5x points on dining.With the Chase Sapphire Preferred, I'm now earning 2x points on all travel and dining spending, plus 2x points for every $1 spent on any other purchase. The Chase Freedom, by comparison, only offered 5x points on dining.This means that I'm now earning 3x points on every dollar spent at restaurants, travel sites, and airlines. I'm also earning 2x points for every dollar spent on any other purchase.The Chase Sapphire Preferred offers a number of other perks, such as 3x points for every $1 spent on all travel and dining purchases made through the Chase Ultimate Rewards program.I'm also earning 3x points for every $1 spent on all travel purchases made through Chase. I'm earning 2x points for every $1 spent on all purchases made at any gas station, grocery store, or drug store.It seems to offer much better value, and that's why I switched to the Chase Sapphire Preferred.The Chase Sapphire Preferred also offers an introductory 0% APR on balance transfers for 15 months, and offers an introductory 0% APR on purchases for 15 months. The Chase Freedom, by comparison, only offered a 0% APR for 12 months on both balance transfers and purchases.This means that I'm earning 3x points on every dollar spent at restaurants, travel sites, and airlines. I'm also earning 2x points for every dollar spent on any other purchase, plus I'm earning 2x points for every dollar spent on any travel purchase I make through Chase.I'm also earning 3x points for every dollar spent on all purchases made at any gas station, grocery store, or drug store.It seems to offer much better value, and that's why I switched to the Chase Sapphire Preferred.This is a pretty interesting question. What is the best credit card? What is the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility?There are a number of factors to consider, but the most important one is the rewards structure. Which rewards structure is the best? What offers the best value, and what will you use it for the most?It's also important to consider the overall value that each card offers. The Chase Sapphire Preferred, for example, is a great card for those who like to travel. It offers a 60,000 point signup bonus, which can be used to book travel, plus it offers 2x points on all travel and dining spending. It also offers 0% APR for 15 months on both balance transfers and purchases.The Chase Freedom, by comparison, only offered a 10,000 point signup bonus, and it only offered 5x points on dining.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. Are there any cards that you recommend over the rest?I\u2019m not sure that there is one card that is the best for everyone, as people\u2019s financial situations are quite different. My recommendation for people is to take their time, do some comparison shopping, and then take the time to understand the benefits of the card and compare them to your current lifestyle and financial situation. In this way, you\u2019re making an educated choice. The card you choose should fit your lifestyle and needs and make sense for you.Some cards can offer you rewards for your spending while others can offer you 0% interest on balance transfers, but you need to find out which is best for you.I think it\u2019s important to remember that a credit card can be a great financial tool if used the right way. It should not be thought of as a source of \u201cfree money\u201d and should not be used if you are not in a position to repay your debt on time and in full.Most credit cards today come with some kind of rewards program or perks attached to them. What would you consider to be the best credit card rewards program currently offered?It\u2019s a matter of which card is the best for you and the rewards you want. I have found that American Express Membership Rewards to be very versatile and easy to redeem. You can use them to pay off your balance or redeem them for travel, gift cards or cash. I use mine for all of these three options. The best rewards program depends on your personal situation and what you want to get out of your credit card.If I had to pick one card with the best overall rewards program, I would probably pick the AMEX Platinum which comes with a host of benefits and rewards, including priority service at airports, as well as a $200 airline credit per year. I have also found the Barclaycard Arrival Plus to be quite versatile as well.Many people find that they rack up rewards faster than they can actually cash in. As a result, they can build up large amounts of points or miles in their accounts. What do you think is the best way for a cardholder to redeem rewards?This depends on the card you have. Some cards are a better fit if you like to travel and some are better for redeeming for cash. I have both types of cards but like to use my AMEX Membership Rewards points for travel. They are flexible and have a host of transfer options, which allow me to use them for travel all over the world.However, I have found that some people just like to get the money back in their pocket and are not interested in travel rewards. They would rather cash them in for a statement credit and get their money back to pay for everyday expenses. This works well for those who do not travel often and want the cash back.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.1) Which credit card do you use?2) What makes it the card of your choice?3) What would you like to see in the card of the future?4) What do you think of the current credit card climate in the U.S.?5) Have you ever used a prepaid card? If so, how has it worked out for you?This is a great discussion topic. I'll start out with a few observations of my own first and then get to your questions.For the past year or so I've been using a no-fee AmEx Blue cash card. The only fee I pay on it is a $1 transaction fee for every out-of-network ATM use. I pay that fee for two reasons. First, it saves me the $1 ATM fee that my bank would otherwise charge me. Second, I've found it to be one of the easiest ways to get cash out of a machine with no hassles. When I used to have my debit card with a brick and mortar bank I would use an in-network ATM and pay a $2 fee, so it was $1 more for nothing.As far as the no-fee AmEx Blue card, I do not have an introductory interest rate of any sort, no APR bonus, and no cash back rewards of any kind. I don't use my credit card to buy gas, groceries, or to pay rent, and I've paid off the entire balance on my card for two years running. So, I can't really complain about paying an ATM fee if I know I won't rack up a balance I can't pay off.I have seen the benefits of getting a card with some sort of rewards program, but I think it's a waste to carry a balance on that kind of card. That's the only reason I got rid of a rewards card I had for a few years. I was a heavy user and racked up a balance of about $4,000 (which is actually very small compared to most credit card balances). I think it would have been a bit insane for me to keep the card and not pay off the balance in full every month, so I got rid of the card.I still get my AmEx Blue cash card every year, but I don't know if I'll use it in 2013. In 2012, I used the $500 cap AmEx Blue cash card I had from last year. It was easy to use, very convenient, and saved me money when it comes to fees (both on ATM withdrawals and foreign currency).As far as what I'd like to see in the card of the future, it would be good if it were easy to pay off and if the fees were low. I'm also not crazy about credit cards that offer more benefits and rewards in exchange for paying an annual fee. The only cards I'd be interested in are no-fee cards. I'd also like a card that could save me money when traveling abroad. There are several cards that offer that kind of coverage, but they all seem to charge fees. That's too much when I could just use my debit card instead.As far as the credit card climate in the U.S., I think it's gotten better in the past few years, but it still has a long way to go. I don't think it's going to improve too much in the near future as long as there are still high-interest, high-balance credit card users. That being said, it does seem like credit card lenders are a bit more responsible and that's a good thing. I don't see many credit cards that charge no-fee, but the interest rates are as high as 30% these days. I don't know if that is because of the new CFPB or not, but I like it better than the old way.As far as prepaid cards go, I've only used one a couple of times when I forgot to bring enough cash with me. I'd like to use them more, but the fees make it expensive to use them as a substitute for debit or credit cards.1) I am currently on a Capital One Venture Rewards credit card with the 50k bonus if you spend $3,000 in the first three months. I have been a Chase Freedom Visa card holder for several years with a zero balance every month and a 5% cash back rate on groceries and dining. I switched over to the Venture Rewards Card because of the cash back rate and also because I found out I can transfer the points to frequent flyer miles which is what I usually do.2) The Venture Rewards Card is the best card I've ever had. It gives you 2x points on all purchases except gas and airlines. I spend a lot on gas and airlines so that makes the card perfect for me. In addition, I've gotten a 50,000 points bonus when I met the $3,000 spending minimum. I also have the benefit of the 5% cash back rate when I need to spend on groceries or dining out.3) I think I'd like to see the card companies offer a better rate of return. The current rate of return on many of the reward cards is a joke compared to the spending that goes on each month. My personal opinion is that I'd rather have a 5% cash back rate on everything I purchase (similar to my Freedom card) and not be rewarded based on where I spend.4) I think the current climate is actually quite good in comparison to what it used to be. I'm pretty sure that some people would disagree with me but the truth is that the credit card companies aren't as greedy as they used to be. Sure, they charge a ton of fees for late payments and the like, but the interest rate is generally lower. When you consider that a credit card is just a loan with a lower interest rate it makes a lot more sense. It's the same thing as a student loan, they give you a lower interest rate but if you don't pay it off in time the interest grows and grows.5) I've never really used a prepaid card. I had an American Express card several years ago that was prepaid but I never used it. I think it's pretty easy to use but it's a pain to get cash from the ATM with a prepaid card.It's difficult to make any judgement on my credit card as it doesn't provide me with any benefits (other than a few bucks to spend on my grocery bill). I use a Citi Double Cash credit card (0% APR for the first 18 months) that I received a few months ago. I have to say that I'm not impressed with the card so far. It seems like they are only interested in trying to get as much interest out of you as possible.I would like to be able to earn more reward points. I also would like it to offer cashback, but it only offers points. In addition, they charge a pretty high interest rate and it takes quite a bit of time to earn the 1% cashback.The credit card climate seems to be getting more reasonable but I still feel that the rates are still too high. I don't use my credit card for many things other than buying groceries and gas, so the rates are very reasonable for me. I'm sure that they would be higher for people that have more expensive spending habits.I've never used a prepaid card before but I'm interested in looking into them. I am currently in the market for a new credit card so I will have to research prepaid cards a little more.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I have a Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Freedom, a Chase Ink Preferred, a Capital One Venture, and a couple of others. Right now my Ink and Freedom have no annual fees and Capital One will cover them next year. I was really happy with the Ink Unlimited when it had no annual fee, but I didn't care for the fact that the card is subject to the 5/24 rule. So, it is still useful to me, but I wish I could be using it for more purchases.The Capital One Venture was another that had an annual fee and has been cancelled. It is a no-fee card with the best cash back program I have seen. It was a lot of fun to watch the balance go up and up. It was nice to be able to travel and save money, but I think I need to consolidate the cards. My wife has a Chase Sapphire Preferred and she is able to use Ultimate Rewards to get better deals on airline and hotel bookings. That makes her a good candidate to take over the Ink Unlimited.I'm still trying to find the right combination for myself. I love the flexibility and security of Chase cards, but don't really need another Chase card. My wife can handle the Chase Preferred and Ultimate Rewards, but I want to find a credit card with low interest rates. I would love to consolidate the Ink Unlimited with another card that has more flexibility.Any suggestions? I am willing to consider any options and any credit scores, since I am in the 700+ range, and she is in the 600+ range.I'm always looking for a new credit card that will offer me more rewards.

This is called the \"Rewards Rate.\" The reward rate is calculated by dividing the number of points you get back by the amount of spending you make. This is important because it tells you how much you're going to get back on your purchases. The rewards rate can be as low as 2%, which means you'll only get 2% back for every dollar you spend. The rewards rate can also be as high as 15%, which means you'll get 15% back for every dollar you spend.The next thing to consider is how much you'll get back if you use the credit card.

The rewards rate can also be as high as 15%, which means it takes 10 days to pay out the rewards.I was recently shopping for a new credit card and I'm always looking for the best rewards.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I'm referring to cash back or rewards credit cards, specifically those which provide 3% cash back on all purchases.There are quite a few cards out there offering this perk.For simplicity's sake, I'll focus on a list of the best cash back credit cards with no annual fee and the best cash back credit cards with no minimum balance requirements.Cards that meet these criteria will appeal to the vast majority of consumers because it's free money.We all love free money.The following are my three picks for the best 3% cash back credit cards.Between the three cards, there are a variety of features and benefits.The information in the following sections will help you determine the card that best suits your needs.If your goal is to get the most money back on all purchases, I recommend the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card.This card is the highest yield cash back credit card that I know of, offering 3% cash back on all purchases.But it doesn't stop there. The card also offers 3% cash back at restaurants, 3% cash back on entertainment, and 3% cash back on travel.The cash back rewards are worth 10% more when redeemed for travel purchases through the Capital One Travel portal.In addition to the cash back, the card also offers 0% interest on all purchases for the first 15 months.This card has no foreign transaction fee, so you won't pay any additional fees when using the card outside of the United States.It has a variable purchase APR of 15.99% to 25.99%, which is the average rate charged on cash back credit cards.Keep in mind that this card has a $95 annual fee.I would only recommend it if you'll be able to make good use of the annual 3% cash back categories.You'll have to keep track of the categories, which can be a hassle if you use the card for all of your purchases.So if you spend a lot on restaurants, entertainment, and travel, the Savor card can be a good deal.The Discover it\u00ae Cash Back credit card offers an unparalleled sign-up bonus.It gives new cardholders $200 cash back after they spend $1,500 in the first three months.But the card doesn't just reward you with sign-up bonuses.In addition to the introductory bonus, you'll also get a $100 cash back bonus after spending $1,000 in the first 12 months.Discover also gives you 1% cash back on every purchase, so it's an all-around solid card that rewards your spending.You can redeem the rewards for cash back, gift cards, or merchandise.The cash back earned will be worth 100% of what you earn. So if you earn $100 in cash back, you'll receive $100 in the form of a statement credit.The card comes with no annual fee, which is good because there are other cards that offer better rewards without charging any annual fees.Its variable purchase APR is 10.99% to 22.99%.Keep in mind that this card does charge an upfront balance transfer fee of 3% of the amount transferred.I recommend the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back if you want to earn money back with no annual fee.It's an excellent card for anyone looking for an easy way to earn cash back.The last pick for the best 3% cash back credit cards is the Citi Double Cash card.The Double Cash card offers 1% cash back on all purchases, so it's not the best rewards card in the bunch.However, its 2% cash back on all purchases category makes it a unique offering.There is no cap on the amount of cash back you can earn and the rewards are worth 100% of what you earn.You can also get a $200 sign-up bonus after spending $1,500 in the first six months.The card also has a great 0% introductory APR on purchases for the first 18 months.This is a welcome perk considering that most credit cards charge a variable purchase APR of 14.49% to 22.49%.There is a $0 annual fee on the card, so it's a good option for anyone looking to get a great deal on cash back rewards.There are a few downsides to the Citi Double Cash card.The first one is that it does charge a foreign transaction fee of 3%. This fee is pretty standard on most cash back credit cards.Another potential drawback is the card's high APR of 17.24% to 25.24%.The rewards are good, but they are worth less than they would be if they weren't capped at 100%.The card is a great choice for people who want to maximize their cash back rewards.It's a good card for anyone looking for an easy way to earn cash back with no annual fee.The bottom line is that all of the cards on the list offer excellent cash back rewards.They are all well-suited to different types of consumers and will likely fit the bill for most people.My top pick is the Citi Double Cash card because it's a great choice for anyone looking to maximize their rewards.But I recommend the other two cards for anyone who doesn't want to pay an annual fee.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I'd appreciate your input. Thanks!I've always had excellent experiences with Chase and am thinking of switching to the Sapphire Preferred Card because I know it offers 20,000 bonus points after you spend $1,000 in the first three months. These points can be redeemed for a 20% discount at hotels.com, travelocity.com, or expedia.com, or 1.25 cents per point for travel.My biggest concern is my credit rating. I just became a U.S. resident three years ago, and have very little experience with credit in this country. How do you think my FICO score will be affected by applying for this card? What about my credit rating in general?Hi, and thanks for your question. It's true that your credit rating can be adversely affected by opening too many credit accounts. That being said, I'd still apply for the Sapphire Preferred Card because you can earn 10,000 bonus points if you use it within the first three months.That brings me to my next point. I know many people get hung up on credit-card bonus point offers. For me, however, I have to weigh the benefits of the offer against the risks of opening a new account. In your case, I think it's safe to assume that you can earn 10,000 points without harming your credit rating or credit standing in any way.My biggest advice is that you not apply for several new credit cards in a short period of time. If you're concerned that a new credit card will adversely affect your credit rating, there's a way to reduce the risk of doing so.My favorite method is to apply for only one card a year. For example, you might want to apply for a travel card and a cash-back card once or twice a year. That way you don't have to worry about applying for a credit card if you're not ready for one.I'd also encourage you to apply for the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. You'll receive 20,000 bonus points if you spend $1,000 within three months of opening your account.The bottom line is that I think the Sapphire Preferred Card offers you excellent perks for a low annual fee. The card also has no annual fee for the first year, and you'll receive $200 in travel credit if you purchase a plane ticket using your card.Overall, I believe the Sapphire Preferred Card offers the best combination of rewards, low interest rates, and financial flexibility. Good luck and happy traveling!</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. How would you describe your personal definition of a perfect credit card?I recently asked this same question to our community over on Reddit, and the discussion that ensued shed some light on the different types of cards that people are using to build their credit or get out of debt.Weighing Credit Card Perks Against RatesI'll give a brief overview of the top five credit cards people cited for their own use, but I'll focus primarily on the perks they get out of each. Many people who have high-interest credit card debt are turning to balance transfer cards to reduce the cost of their monthly payments. If that sounds like you, then a balance transfer card is definitely in order.In addition to low rates, balance transfer cards typically offer an introductory period of 0% interest. This allows you to consolidate your high-interest debt into a single, low-interest loan, and if you pay it off in full during the introductory period, you'll avoid paying any interest on your balance at all. Some balance transfer cards don't charge a balance transfer fee.Best Balance Transfer Card: Chase SlateChase's Slate card has one of the best 0% introductory offers on the market\u2014an introductory period of 15 months on balance transfers and new purchases. And while the standard APR is 15.24% variable APR, it has no annual fee, no balance transfer fee, and the introductory rate is retroactive to your first day of membership. That means that your balance transfers won't count against your 15-month period, even if they were completed before you signed up for the card.Best Starter Credit Card: Capital One PlatinumI'm a big fan of Capital One's Platinum card. It has no annual fee, which is great for people looking to build credit. But unlike some starter credit cards, it has an introductory offer of 0% for new purchases for 15 months, along with a 0% balance transfer offer for the first 15 months. This means you can use the card to build your credit, and even take advantage of a 0% balance transfer to pay off debt.Best Cash-Back Card: Chase FreedomIf you spend a lot on gas, dining out, and purchases made through PayPal, you'll get the most from the Chase Freedom Unlimited. But there are lots of cash-back cards that work similarly. For instance, the Discover it Cashback Match offers 1% unlimited cash back on all purchases, which is then matched with 1% from the first year. That means 2% cash back on all purchases. There is a $0 annual fee.Best Credit-Building Card: Capital One PlatinumCapital One offers several credit-building cards with different features. But its Platinum card offers one of the best introductory periods, along with a reasonable APR of 26.99% variable APR. There is no annual fee and it's easy to apply for the card online in just a few minutes.Best Flagship Card: Citi ThankYou PreferredCiti's flagship ThankYou Preferred card offers 10% cash back in the form of ThankYou points at gas stations and drug stores, and it also earns 2x points on restaurants and entertainment. It also offers 1x point on all other purchases, and you can redeem ThankYou points for cash back at an effective 1 cent apiece. If you travel frequently, you might find that the Citi Prestige offers more value with its 5x points at air travel and hotels.What Makes a Perfect Credit Card?For me, the ideal credit card offers low rates, a 0% balance transfer offer, and decent rewards. It's great for everyday spending, and it has no annual fee. If you're trying to build credit, a card with a low rate and no annual fee is probably your best bet. If you have a lot of credit card debt, then a balance transfer card is in order. But a lot of people with debt are also using these cards to improve their credit rating.This type of card is the best for those who want a simple option that can help them build credit. Many of these cards also have low rates and may offer other features, such as cash-back rewards. These cards are good for people who don't need balance transfer offers, but they are good for those who want a credit-building card.A balance transfer card is a great option if you have a lot of debt and want to consolidate it into one, low-interest loan. This type of card usually has a lower interest rate than a cash-back card, which makes it a great choice for people who want to pay off their credit card debt.The best card for building your credit is the one with the lowest interest rate and the lowest fees. You can get both with a balance transfer card, so it's a great choice if you have high-interest credit card debt.A balance transfer card is a good option for those who want to build their credit, but they don't have much credit history yet. With a balance transfer card, you can transfer your high-interest credit card debt to a lower-interest card, and you can pay it off faster.If you want to get a credit card but don't know what type of card is best for you, the best thing to do is to figure out your goals. Do you want to build your credit? Pay off your debt? Earn rewards? Do you want to do all of those things? Once you figure out what you want to do, you can figure out the best credit card for you.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. And while I can't speak for everyone, I do have my favorites.My preferred credit cardMy preferred credit card, without question, is the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae. It boasts a 15-month 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers, and I also receive 1.5% cash back on every purchase. In short, the card offers a great combination of low interest rates, no annual fee, and a steady flow of rewards that I can actually use.A close runner-up is the Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card. I like that it offers 2 miles per dollar on purchases, and that you can transfer those rewards to 11 travel partners. But what really sets it apart is the 0% intro APR on purchases, balance transfers, and both the balance transfer fee and the annual fee for 12 months. So you can use it to pay off a high interest debt, and earn bonus rewards along the way.I think the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card is a great all-around credit card. Not only do you get an unlimited 2% cash back on all purchases, but the 18-month 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers can be extremely useful if you need a little extra time to pay off high-interest debt. The rewards are easy to redeem, and it has no annual fee or foreign transaction fees.The Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card also has my attention. In addition to the 0% intro APR on purchases, it offers 1.5 points for every dollar you spend on travel and dining purchases, and 0.5 points per dollar spent on all other purchases. You can redeem those points for travel through the bank's Ultimate Rewards program, which allows you to get more value out of each point. The downside is that you must be a Bank of America checking or savings account holder to qualify for the card.Lastly, I would like to mention the Bank of America\u00ae Cash Rewards credit card. It offers an intro 0% APR on balance transfers and purchases for 21 months, and rewards of 1% cash back on all purchases. However, unlike most other cards on this list, the cash rewards you earn have to be redeemed through Bank of America's Cash Rewards Center. This means you have to enroll in the service, and you may receive a lower redemption value than if you redeem your rewards for travel.Overall, I think the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae is my top pick. It offers a great combination of low interest rates, rewards, and flexibility. So if you're looking for a credit card that offers all-around value, the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae is worth considering.What are your top 3 credit cards?The Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae is one of my top 3 credit cards.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. It's interesting to note that many cardholders often prefer a different card for different reasons. For instance, a student may prefer a card with low interest rates, while a frequent traveler may go for a card with great perks and low annual fees.While you may have your own preferences, I believe that the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card \u2013 18 month BT offer is the best credit card on the market. While some other cards may offer better rates, or better perks, the Citi Double Cash Card is the only card I know of that offers a zero percent introductory APR, and no balance transfer fees. While the APR is high, a 0 percent interest rate for 18 months could save cardholders hundreds of dollars on interest if the balance is paid off in full. While the annual fee is a little higher than other cards, this card has no fees for balance transfers, which saves you money in the long run.So, what do you think? What's the best credit card?Awesome article! I totally agree with you. I have the Citi Double Cash and it\u2019s my favorite credit card.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. What credit card do you own, and why do you prefer that credit card over others?I own an Amex BCE card. I like the rewards for travel. However, I'm planning on cancelling my card because I want to stop spending a lot of money. If someone knows a good card that pays out to cash instead of travel, I would appreciate it.If you could take the best features of any credit card you've ever owned and combine them into a single card, what would that card look like?Whenever I make a large purchase, I like to use a credit card because it allows me to defer the payment for a few months. I also like to earn frequent flier miles whenever I use my credit card, which is why I choose my Amex BCE card over other cards.My credit card of choice is the Chase Freedom. I chose this card because it's fairly easy to earn free flights, and because I can get 5% cash back on various categories every three months. It's nice not to have to think about a rewards card since the rewards appear in my account automatically.I like my Chase Sapphire Preferred card for the travel rewards.I have had this card for many years and I've always been happy with the program. I recently received a new offer to transfer my card from Chase to the new Capital One Venture Rewards Card, and the new card offers an annual travel credit of up to $100 for travel purchases charged to the card.I love that my Chase Freedom card automatically gives me 5% cash back on certain categories every three months. It's very easy to earn enough cash back every three months to pay off a large purchase.I don't have any credit cards, but if I did, I'd choose the Discover Card because I've had good luck with it in the past. I like the fact that Discover gives you cash back, plus an extra cash bonus for using the card.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. Are you an AMEX holder or a Chase Freedom cardholder? Do you prefer one of the major banks over the major credit unions? Or, if you're not yet familiar with some of the major players, are you simply not sure which one suits your lifestyle best?To help you sort out the most important factors, below is a brief description of a few of the best options for credit cards. We'll take a close look at two of the most popular options from the big banks -- American Express and Chase -- as well as some of the top options from credit unions and smaller banks.Here are the best credit cards of 2013.Chase Freedom -- The best combination of perks and financial flexibility.With the Chase Freedom, the biggest selling point is the low interest rate on new purchases. This card offers a competitive APR on new purchases of 13.24% with a balance transfer option. In addition to low interest rates, the Chase Freedom also offers 1% cash back on all purchases, so you can get reimbursed for nearly everything you buy.The biggest downside to the Chase Freedom is the annual fee. But considering the card's low interest rate and cash back perks, it's a worthwhile expense for some.A second downside to the Chase Freedom is that the card does not offer travel rewards. This is a major disadvantage if you plan on taking frequent trips and want to take advantage of credit card points.American Express SPG -- A perfect option for business owners.The American Express SPG card is designed for the business owner in mind. The annual fee on this card is steep, but you can easily earn it back through the free nights and hotel rewards.One of the biggest advantages of the American Express SPG is the free nights, which give cardholders one free night in hotels that cost up to 30,000 points every year. If you're a frequent traveler who stays at hotels throughout the year, this is a great perk. In addition, the hotel rewards program gives you a point for each dollar you spend on a hotel.The biggest downside to the American Express SPG is the lack of low interest rates and perks on purchases. The interest rates and perks on the card are focused solely on travel rewards. So, this card is great for business owners who travel often, but not so great for someone who spends money in other places, such as on groceries and gas.USAA Cashback Rewards -- A perfect option for someone who doesn't travel.If you don't travel frequently or like to stay at specific hotels, the USAA Cashback Rewards card is an ideal option. This card has a low APR and gives cardholders 1% cash back for each dollar they spend.The only downside to the USAA Cashback Rewards card is that it has a very low interest rate. While the 1% cash back per dollar you spend is ideal, many other cards have lower interest rates than this.One of the best ways to compare credit card options is to do so side-by-side. The following chart, which you can find here, gives you a detailed comparison between the American Express SPG, USAA Cashback Rewards, and the Chase Freedom.It's easy to get bogged down in the credit card application process and forget which card offers the most cash back or which one offers the lowest interest rate. The chart below gives you a quick way to compare several of the best options so you can easily figure out which card is best for your lifestyle.Which credit card is best for you? The answer depends on your lifestyle. But whatever card you choose, make sure to pay off your balance each month and to keep your finances in check. If you can stick to those two golden rules, any credit card will be perfect for you.Joe Cortez is a personal finance blogger and the founder of DollarForDollar.com.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.It\u2019s no secret that credit card debt is on the rise, and the Federal Reserve recently found that 45% of Americans have a balance on their credit cards. It\u2019s more important than ever to get a credit card with a great balance transfer offer, rewards program, or a combination of both.I personally like having one credit card that offers low interest and good rewards points, as long as those rewards aren\u2019t too hard to earn.So, if you\u2019re curious to know which credit card you should be considering, we\u2019ve got a few suggestions that might make your decision easier.Before we dive in, I\u2019ll warn you that there are some great options below and it may be tough to pick one over another. Just remember that your credit and income play a huge role in determining which card you can qualify for, so make sure you know where you stand before you begin the application process.With that in mind, here are the best credit cards to consider in 2018.If you can\u2019t qualify for an offer like this (like if you have bad credit), you can always take a look at credit card offers from issuers that focus more on customers with fair and good credit. That said, a company like Capital One has some really great offers for customers with good credit, so you\u2019re not going to be out of luck.One of the best things about this card is that you\u2019ll get 0% on both new purchases and balance transfers for 20 months (or up to 21 months, depending on the terms offered). After that, you\u2019ll be charged an 11.9% interest rate.As far as the rewards you earn, Capital One offers a simple 2% cash back program (1% back on the date of purchase, and an additional 1% back six months later).However, to be eligible for this card, you\u2019ll need to have a credit score of at least 690.The APR for the Sapphire Preferred card is slightly lower at 13.99%-22.99% based on your creditworthiness, and you\u2019ll also earn 2x points for dining, travel, and even on transit and gas stations.Between those two cards, I would lean toward the Sapphire Preferred for a number of reasons. For starters, the card\u2019s 20-month offer is a little more enticing, and that could come in handy if you\u2019re looking to pay off your credit card balance before a large expense (like a wedding).Additionally, the travel rewards and dining/gas station benefits are worth considering, and you can get cash back on travel when you book through Chase\u2019s Ultimate Rewards portal.If you want to qualify for either card, you\u2019ll need a minimum annual income of $30,000.While you might be able to qualify for the Capital One Venture card without a strong income, the Chase Sapphire Preferred card has a few requirements that will limit your chances of being approved.The first requirement is a credit score of at least 690. That said, there are some options available that can help you build your credit, and I\u2019d suggest looking into those if you\u2019re worried about your current score.The next requirement is an income of at least $30,000 a year. If your income is higher than that, you shouldn\u2019t have a problem qualifying for this card.While you\u2019ll earn unlimited 1.5% cash back with the BankAmericard, it only has a 0% interest rate for 6 months. Plus, there\u2019s no rewards program attached to this credit card.If you have bad or fair credit, you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere.It also doesn\u2019t have a rewards program attached to it, but you do get some nice perks.For starters, you\u2019ll get a $150 cash back bonus if you spend $500 on the card in the first 90 days of owning it.You\u2019ll also be able to take advantage of Discover\u2019s Miles program, which allows you to collect 1.5x miles on every dollar spent on travel.As you can see, there\u2019s a bit of a tradeoff between the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Capital One Venture cards.Both cards offer 0% interest for the first 18 months and you\u2019ll earn rewards that can be used for travel, dining, and more.The Capital One Venture card offers rewards on both dining and travel that can be used with a variety of providers, which could be a huge help if you\u2019re looking to book your next vacation. Additionally, you\u2019ll have the ability to use your cash back as a statement credit or check, which is convenient if you want to make your payment with cash.The Sapphire Preferred card, on the other hand, offers rewards you can use for travel booked through Chase\u2019s Ultimate Rewards portal. In other words, you can\u2019t simply redeem your points for cash back (as you can with the Capital One card), but that might not be a big deal for some people.I would also give the nod to the Capital One Venture card if you\u2019re looking to earn rewards. While the Sapphire Preferred card offers some good rewards, the Capital One Venture card offers unlimited rewards, which means you can collect more points as you use the card for everyday purchases.Of course, you can also use your points for travel booked through Chase\u2019s Ultimate Rewards portal, but if you have to pay a travel charge for your ticket, you\u2019ll be taking home less cash.Finally, while the Sapphire Preferred card has a 0% interest rate for a longer period of time, you\u2019ll be paying a higher APR afterward (13.99%-22.99%, depending on your credit score).On the other hand, the Capital One Venture card has a lower APR, though it only lasts for 18 months. After that, you\u2019ll be charged an APR between 12.99% and 22.99%, which is still lower than what you\u2019ll pay with the Sapphire Preferred card.If you have good credit, I\u2019d recommend considering the Capital One Venture card. It offers a great 0% interest promotion, unlimited rewards, and an APR that isn\u2019t too high after you reach the end of the promotion period.However, if you have bad or fair credit, I\u2019d recommend taking a look at one of the options from Wells Fargo and Bank of America.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.For the time being, my primary card of choice is the Citi Diamond Preferred Card\u00ae, which is an outstanding balance transfer option. This is primarily because of the fact that I don't use the card for anything other than making balance transfers and paying off the transfer balance in full.While the 21-month 0% introductory APR on balance transfers and purchases does not expire until the balance transfer has been paid off, the interest rate after that will likely be in the neighborhood of 17.99% or greater. Since I don't pay any interest charges (because I make payments in excess of the minimum), this is not an issue for me.When you consider that I receive an excellent 5% cash back bonus on all purchases made with this card, I am also well compensated for my financial discipline in this regard.For cash back rewards, I use the Discover It\u00ae Card. I enjoy earning the 5% cash back on purchases at restaurants and gas stations, as well as on purchases in other categories (including travel), each quarter. In addition, I appreciate the ease of earning 1% cash back on all of my other purchases.I have a Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card, which is the card with which I earn the most cash back each year. However, it doesn't earn any bonus categories of cash back; instead, it gives you 1.5% cash back on all purchases.It is worthwhile to have a card that you use for all of your purchases in order to maximize your earnings.When I have a specific use for a new purchase that I do not intend to pay off immediately, I usually use my Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card, which has a 2-year 0% introductory APR.In addition, there is the possibility of earning 60,000 Ultimate Rewards points after making $4,000 in purchases within the first three months of opening the card, which is an additional benefit. In this situation, I like to keep my balance at a minimum of $500 to maximize the benefits of the 21-month 0% introductory APR period.I have a few other cards in my wallet, but this is by far the most frequently used and well-liked of the bunch.Since you have more credit cards, the amount you pay in interest will also increase. As a result, you will need to be more cautious about your spending habits and pay off your balances more quickly to avoid paying interest. If you spend more than you can afford to pay off, you should always pay at least the minimum payment in order to avoid paying interest.If you want to make sure that you will be able to make the payments, only take out a credit card that you can easily pay off in full each month. It is not worthwhile to incur debt on a credit card if you will be required to pay interest on it.If you want to keep your credit score high, only use credit cards that have a low interest rate. Even if you have a high credit limit and are only using a portion of it, the total amount of credit available to you can be a factor in your credit score.Because the minimum payment requirement is determined by the credit limit that has been assigned to your account, the lower the credit limit, the higher your minimum payment will be. This is a significant disadvantage for people who are required to make a minimum payment in order to prevent default.Using credit cards to pay for small expenses like groceries and gasoline on a regular basis is a good way to increase your credit limit and improve your credit score.Your credit score is impacted when you use a credit card to pay for expensive items such as a new automobile or home improvement.Your credit score is affected by the types of things you use credit cards to buy.To improve your credit score, you should make at least the minimum payment each month. Make sure that you don't have any outstanding balances on your cards, which is one of the quickest ways to increase your credit score.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.For those of you who use several cards, I'd like to know which one you think is your favorite.As you can imagine, I get a lot of requests for credit card recommendations, and for a while now, I've been telling people that the Citi Double Cash is my favorite. In my book, it's a near-perfect combination of great perks (including rewards and low interest rates), and low cost.But I've been using Chase Sapphire Reserve for years, and as I said on Twitter last night, I'm starting to see the light.Here's what I like about Citi Double Cash:I get 2% back on all purchases, which can be a significant annual reward given the $12,000 minimum spending limit.If I get hit with interest charges, they're 13.99% - 23.99% for cash advances. In other words, they're reasonable (but I've been in the 13.99% range for years).Aside from the 2% rewards program, there are no other fees.Here's what I like about Chase Sapphire Reserve:The 50% travel rewards bonus is incredible.The airline credit and $300 annual travel credit are great perks.The $100 Saks Fifth Avenue statement credit can help you save big.The airport lounge access, which is limited but still nice.The 3x points on travel and 2x points on dining, which can help you save money.I like both cards, but I think there's a case to be made that the Reserve is more valuable than the Double Cash.If you were to pick a favorite, which card would it be? And why?For the Citi card, you need to be approved, or you can go in and get a card. They'll do a soft pull, but that will go away after a few days. I've had the same CC since 2002.Jeremy February 22, 2019 at 7:44 AMFor me, the best card is the one I have that gives me the most benefit. For example, the Ink Plus offers 5x in certain categories and therefore, I'd pick that if I'm making a purchase in one of those categories. I'd also use the Uber Visa if I plan on spending money with Uber because of the 4% cashback, and if I wanted to get a free roundtrip, I'd use the Southwest Visa.Andrew T February 22, 2019 at 8:21 AMI like having the Chase Freedom Unlimited. I use it for groceries and gas, both of which get 1.5X.I like having my Amex Premier Rewards Gold, but it only offers 1 point per dollar spent, so it's not really a great deal for me.Honestly, my credit card game is not the most important financial decision I make everyday.But I do find the travel rewards game a bit interesting and that is one of the main reasons I picked up the Chase Sapphire Reserve.But in the end, it's not much different from the Citi Double Cash or some other Cash Back cards.I still have a couple of other Chase cards from before the Reserve came out. I will probably stick with those until I feel the need for the Reserve.Personally, I think the CSR's travel rewards bonus is a complete and utter ripoff.It should be called the Chase Sapphire $500 Bonus. $500 for spending $4,000 is ridiculous.And that bonus only lasts for the first 3 months after opening the account.Once that's gone, what're you left with? Nothing.Few miles, which aren't worth anything in my book.The only thing I can say for the Reserve is that it gives me the benefit of \"having the Reserve.\"And that feels good for some reason.I have the Chase Ink Preferred which gives me 3X points on travel, shipping, internet and cable, as well as office supply stores and telecom.I also have the Chase Freedom card which is the no-annual fee version of the Chase Freedom Unlimited card. This gives me 5% cash back on rotating categories, and also has some other perks like no foreign transaction fees and a 15% bonus when you redeem your points for cash.If I was to choose between them, I'd go with the Freedom Unlimited because of the higher cash back rate, but I'd rather have the Ink card because of the 5X category.I think the best card is going to be the one you like the most. So it could be a number of things. CSR might be the best card if you like all the other perks like the $300 travel credit, the 50% rewards bonus, the $100 Saks gift card, and the Priority Pass. But to me, it's still just a cashback card. And the only reason I like the cashback card is because I'm a frequent traveler. If I had more cash than I knew what to do with, the cashback cards wouldn't appeal to me much.I prefer the cashback cards because they give me a little something for spending money that I wouldn't normally spend. That's why I like the Citi Double Cash card. I'm also a big fan of the Chase Freedom Unlimited because it has no foreign transaction fees, and I'm not a big fan of CSR's foreign transaction fee.It really comes down to what you use the card for and what you're comfortable with. But you can't go wrong with the Freedom Unlimited. It's a no-annual-fee cashback card, so I like that.The CSR would be my second choice because of the $300 travel credit and the Priority Pass. Those are great perks, but the $100 Saks card is a lot less valuable to me.And if you're not a big traveler, the CSR probably isn't a great choice.If you're asking me which is best in a vacuum, that's tough to say because they're not comparable in their benefits and perks. But if I had to choose between the two, I'd have to go with the Citi card. I think it has better benefits than the CSR.The Chase Ink Preferred card is a great card if you're looking to maximize your travel rewards. The annual fee is $95, which is reasonable considering how much you can get in terms of travel rewards.If you don't want to pay an annual fee, the Chase Ink Unlimited card is a great option. The only downside is that it doesn't have any rewards categories to earn bonus points in.I like the Ink Preferred because it's a cash back card that I can use for travel rewards. It's a no annual fee card so I can use it for everyday purchases and then use the travel rewards for things like hotels and airfare.JP February 22, 2019 at 9:07 AMI recently got approved for the Chase Ink Preferred card which offers 5X points on travel, shipping, internet and cable, as well as office supply stores and telecom.

This gives me 5% cash back on rotating categories, and also has some other perks like no foreign transaction fees and a 15% bonus when you redeem your points for cash.I've been using the Double Cash card for a few years now and it's a great card to use for cash back and rewards.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I'm in the market for a new credit card that can be used as a primary form of payment (e.g. groceries, etc.).My ideal situation would be to pay off the balance in full each month, and only use the perks (air miles, cash back, etc.) of the card every once in a while.I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. If you have no knowledge of Canadian credit cards, it's fine to say that. If you know of some great cards in the US that are comparable, please let me know.A few years ago, I had the MBNA World Mastercard with an annual fee of $45. That was the time of year where credit card companies were offering bonus points for getting new credit cards, so I signed up for that card and got 10,000 points (in 2 categories). That was enough to get us a free weekend stay at a nice hotel (e.g. Marriott Residence Inn).Now that I'm looking to renew my card, I find that it now has a $79 annual fee.I'm not sure how the new card compares to MBNA's old World Mastercard, but the new MBNA Platinum Mastercard appears to be less favorable.The MBNA World Mastercard appears to offer a higher credit limit and higher bonus points for travel expenses, but with the annual fee, I don't think it's a good deal for me. I don't travel outside of North America often and the travel expenses I make are usually within Canada (e.g. Air Canada).The RBC Rewards Mastercard (which has an annual fee of $25) seems to be the best bet, especially because it also gives me a 30 day grace period when I pay my bill on time.I like the RBC Rewards Mastercard and have been using it since the fall of 2007. I also have the RBC Travel Rewards Mastercard but haven't been using it much since the introduction of the Aeroplan Plus Mastercard which is better for travellers.If you're interested in a card with a better perk selection, try the American Express Platinum Cards. They are only available to those who are able to qualify for a high limit account but they have a large list of perks. The current offer is 50,000 AMEX points when you spend a certain amount on the card within a set period.For a credit card with a low annual fee and good rewards you can also look at Capital One. They also offer a great rewards program and no annual fee on their no fee MasterCard. The sign up bonus is also very good - 10,000 Aeroplan miles for a $500 purchase in the first three months and then another 20,000 Aeroplan miles after $3000 in purchases in the next six months.I personally don't like American Express because I can't pay online, which means that I'd always have to write a check.With Capital One, if you use PayPal then you can always pay online.I don't think I could live with a high-limit account and a high credit limit either.It is not that easy to find a low cost credit card. What I always look for is an annual fee that is less than 3% of the credit limit. It will usually be about $30-$50 per year but that is the only way to ensure you get the best return.Most no-fee credit cards have such a low limit that the annual fee would be well over 10% of the limit.In the end, I'm more than happy to pay a $50 annual fee for the travel points. As long as I pay my bill on time and don't make any over-limit fees, I can still get the travel points and the extended grace period.I have an Amex AERO cards. This is a \"travel rewards\" card but you do have to redeem the points through AERO and you have to charge about $1,500 per month to get a decent amount of points back. The problem is that this card is difficult to qualify for. I got mine about 10 years ago, and I'm still happy with it.I have an American Express credit card and there are so many perks that go with it. I like the fact that I get extra points for every dollar spent and the card has no annual fees.It's nice to have a credit card with perks but sometimes I think I can be a little spoiled by them. I'm getting too used to my credit card rewards and I don't think about them as much.I just received the card in the mail and it's a nice card.My only complaint is that the annual fee is a little steep.I've had my TD Visa card for a while and so far I really like it. There are no fees and the interest rate is decent. I've never had any problems with the card.It's always good to look at different credit cards and compare what they offer. I'm always looking at my credit card and thinking about what the next perk or reward is. I like that. I never thought of this in terms of looking at it as a financial tool.I always look at my credit card and how much it would cost to pay off my debt on it and the interest.I've been thinking about switching to a different credit card and this is the first time I've ever thought about looking at it as a financial tool.I don't use my credit card very often, and I'm sure I could use a better card, but it's nice to have some perks.I'm looking for a new card with the same interest rate and no annual fee. I'm in no hurry so I don't mind waiting a couple of months to get a better offer.It's hard to find a good credit card.I've never had a good experience with a credit card. The interest rate and fees are always too high and it's never been easy to pay off the debt.The best advice I have heard on this topic is to use a credit card that does not have any fees.If you are looking for a good credit card, you can get a lot of perks. Just make sure you know what the fees are.I don't use my credit card often. I don't have to. I have a debit card and that does the same thing.I don't use my credit card often.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I'd really appreciate hearing what you believe is the best card out there. I'm always curious to know how my readers think.My recommendation is a little different from the usual. I would say the best overall is the Chase Freedom\u00ae. Here are my reasons for picking it as the best of all the travel credit cards.Chase has a 5/24 rule. This means if you have opened 5 or more credit cards in the last 24 months (from all banks) you will not get approved for a credit card from them, at least for a while. This means you may want to think twice about getting a Southwest card, as that might be your 6th one. The Chase Freedom is an excellent choice for those who want a no-annual-fee credit card.The Chase Freedom\u00ae offers 5% cash back on select spending categories that change every quarter (up to $1,500 per quarter). I believe you should try to focus your spending in these categories, because there is a chance you will spend more than $1,500 per quarter in that category, meaning that you will get 5% back on more than $1,500. That's a good thing.After spending $1,500 per quarter in 5% categories, your cash back earnings will drop to 1%. However, all purchases that you don't spend in the 5% categories will earn you 1% cash back. This is great. I can't think of a better program than this.All cash back is redeemed as a statement credit. You can do this any time. No hoops to jump through. Just choose your rewards and spend.The Chase Freedom\u00ae has a $0 annual fee. This card is also a no-annual-fee card. This is a really important feature. Credit cards should not cost you money.The Chase Freedom\u00ae comes with free access to more than 900+ airport lounges worldwide. With TSA Pre\u2713, you get to go through the security checkpoints with no need to remove your shoes, belt or take out your laptop. The Chase Freedom\u00ae is not an airline credit card, but it does come with free access to airport lounges.What about the other no-annual-fee cards? I feel the Chase Freedom\u00ae is superior to the Discover it\u00ae and the Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card, though the Chase Freedom is not as good as the Barclaycard Arrival Plus\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae, which offers 5x points in the 2 spending categories that you choose (up to $50,000 in purchases per year). The Chase Freedom is better than the PenFed Pathfinder Rewards American Express\u00ae card, and it's definitely better than the PenFed Platinum Rewards Mastercard\u00ae, and the PenFed Premium Travel Rewards American Express\u00ae card.Now what about the Barclaycard Arrival Plus\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae? This is a better choice than the Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card, and it's better than the Discover it\u00ae. It is also a better choice than the Chase Freedom\u00ae. The Barclaycard Arrival Plus\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae has a $0 annual fee, 1.8% back in all spending categories, and a 2% back in one bonus spending category (rotating quarterly). This is definitely a good choice.I don't want to compare the Barclaycard Arrival Plus\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae with the Chase Freedom\u00ae, because the Chase Freedom\u00ae is a no-annual-fee card. This is a better choice for people who want to avoid an annual fee.What about the Southwest Rapid Rewards\u00ae Premier Credit Card? I don't like the fact that you can't earn more than 3x points (12,000 points per year) on Southwest airfare purchases. I would have no problem getting 5% back on Southwest purchases (2,500 points per $1,000), but 3x seems to be the standard for airline credit cards.I feel the Barclaycard Arrival Plus\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae is better than the Southwest Rapid Rewards\u00ae Premier Credit Card. It's also better than the United MileagePlus\u00ae Club Card from Chase and the British Airways Visa\u00ae Signature Card.If you can only have one credit card, I think the Chase Freedom\u00ae is a good choice. You will get 5% back on spending in the rotating 5% bonus categories each quarter, and 1% back on all other spending. It has no annual fee. You can redeem cash back any time as a statement credit. The Chase Freedom\u00ae is good at airport lounges worldwide. I think it's the best no-annual-fee credit card on the market.I also have the Chase Freedom but I'm not sure it's the best of all cards... especially since I have the Barclay Arrival Plus and the American Express Platinum.If you use the Arrival Plus to pay for a flight that's not with the partner airline you're still getting a 2% return (3X). If you're using the Amex Platinum to pay for a flight that's not with the partner airline you're still getting 5X.But for most other spending I agree the Chase Freedom is one of the best cards to have.My take is that the Chase Freedom is the best all around card but the Amex Platinum is the best airline card.I would also add that you should definitely get the Chase Freedom if you don't already have 5 or more cards from Chase. I don't know of another no annual fee card that comes with this perk.I've already used my 5/24 rule so I'm hoping the Chase Freedom will let me have the Amex Platinum and the Chase Freedom.I do not have the Chase Sapphire Preferred so I cannot have that card and the Freedom. But I can still have the Freedom?And what if you already have a Chase Sapphire Preferred, a United card (since those also do not count) and a Marriott card? Would that still make me OK for the Freedom?I'm just trying to figure out if I can really have the Freedom, Platinum, and Preferred.Also, can you explain how you get the 5% rewards? I've never gotten more than 3x for flight on my Chase Sapphire Preferred and I haven't been able to figure out how to get the 5% back. Can you help me understand it better?I'm not really sure I understand what you are saying. Are you saying that you can't get the Chase Freedom card because you already have a Chase Sapphire Preferred card? I'm pretty sure you can get that card as well.I agree that it's a good card to get, but I disagree with it being the best overall. I'd say the best is the Platinum Card from American Express. If you're planning on paying $200 a year for a card, I'd suggest the Amex Platinum over the Chase Freedom (which is $0). And you'd earn 5X on airfare booked through AmexTravel.com instead of 5% back on the Chase Freedom.The best all around card is the Chase Sapphire Preferred (and Chase Freedom) in my opinion.I have both the Platinum and the Chase Freedom. But I use the Freedom far more often. It has no annual fee, and I have it because I want a no annual fee card. I would much rather pay $89 for the Chase Sapphire Preferred and not have an annual fee on either.I find it very hard to believe that you have both cards, but still use the Freedom more often. What do you mean you have both cards?Yes, the Chase Freedom\u00ae card is great because of the 5% bonus cash back categories. I love it. But you could get 2x in all spending categories by using the Barclaycard Arrival Plus\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae, so I wouldn't say that makes the Freedom the best card overall.I agree with you on the 5% bonus cash back categories. If you get the Barclaycard Arrival Plus\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae, you could get 2% cash back on all purchases. I would have no problem redeeming this as a statement credit.I do not have any idea what you mean. Are you saying that you have both cards, and still find it hard to believe you use the Freedom more often?How do you get 5% back? I've gotten 5% back on travel purchases in my bonus categories a few times but usually it's 3%. And since there are only 5 categories, there's always one that I don't care about. I'd love to get 5% back on everything!Also, I have the Platinum, Gold and Freedom. I have the Platinum for the 5x airfare purchases. The Gold for the 4x travel purchases and the Freedom for the 5% bonus categories.I think you misunderstood the question. I did not say \"I find it hard to believe I use the Freedom more often\", but \"I find it hard to believe that you have both cards, but still use the Freedom more often\".I'm sure you know what I mean. If you don't, I'll clarify. I have both the Freedom and the Arrival Plus. But I prefer to use the Freedom more often. I don't think it's hard to believe, since the 5% cash back bonus categories are the best thing about the Freedom.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.For example, Chase Freedom Unlimited gives you 1.5% cash back on everything, no annual fee, and a 15-month 0% APR on purchases (the Slate Edge doesn't have a sign-up bonus, but that 0% APR lasts for 15 months).The Slate Edge (not to be confused with the Slate 2021) has a lower credit limit, but still has the same introductory APR of 0% for the first 15 months.The Amex Everyday Card (the Amex Gold or Amex Platinum) has a $50 cash back bonus and a $100 bonus for signing up for a new card, but the sign-up bonus can only be redeemed for merchandise (and the cash back isn't automatic).The Slate Edge card has the same 0% introductory APR as the Slate 2020 (the original Slate), but it's only for 9 months, and it has a higher minimum annual fee of $395 compared to $350.But is it worth it? Here are a few points to consider when deciding which card to choose:1. Amount of credit you want to get. You will probably want to apply for at least two credit cards. For example, if you have a Slate Edge and a Slate 2021, you can transfer your Slate 2021 balance to the Slate Edge in order to take advantage of the 0% APR.2. Credit history. Credit cards with a high annual fee require a good credit score to get approved. A 680 score is considered good, but a 690 or 700 score is considered excellent.3. Balance transfer. You can transfer your balance to another card with a lower interest rate if you don't have much of a balance to transfer.4. Rewards programs. Some cards give you cash back, but others offer travel points. If you like to travel, you may want to go with a travel card.5. Annual fee. If you don't pay your credit card balance in full every month, you should consider getting a card with a lower annual fee.6. No annual fee. The Slate Edge card has no annual fee, which is great if you want to avoid paying for the privilege of being able to access your credit limit.7. Cash back. If you like getting cash back on purchases, you may want to go with a cash back card.8. Free trial. Some credit cards offer a free trial. You can use the free trial to find out if the card is right for you before you apply for it.9. No minimum annual fee.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.This is my primary question to the members here on CreditCards.com:Which credit card is your best choice right now?You can't vote for more than one option, so choose the one that will work best for you.What is your primary credit card?Quote from: JBS on April 17, 2014, 09:46:59 AMIn my opinion the Capital One Platinum card is a great option. There is no annual fee and no interest is charged on purchases and cash advances if you pay them off within 26 days of the statement closing date. They also recently changed their rewards program so you can redeem your rewards for gift cards or direct deposit to your bank account. The new Platinum card also offers Visa Signature perks and is now made of metal.That being said I have the Chase Freedom card and it is my primary card.\u00ab Last Edit: April 23, 2014, 08:42:46 AM by tj \u00bbQuote from: jb7979 on April 17, 2014, 09:52:47 AMRight now, I believe my Amex Blue Cash Preferred card is the best fit for me. It's a cash back card (5% at US supermarkets), but I also have a Chase Freedom card that gives me 5% on gas/travel/dining/etc., so I've gotten a lot of value from it. The APR is a little high (13.74%) if you carry a balance, but I pay it off every month, so I don't mind.I'm still undecided. I currently have the American Express Blue Cash Everyday card (3% on all purchases) and I do not have any balance, so I think I'll go with that one for now.I'm in the process of switching over to the Chase Freedom card (3% on gas/travel/dining/etc.) and am hoping that I get that one. I also have the Chase Sapphire Preferred card (2x points on travel/dining) and it's been a great card so far.If I didn't already have the CSP, then I would get the CFR (although I do not travel or dine out frequently).Right now, I'm not using any credit cards. However, I will be applying for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card soon, and when I get it I'm sure it'll be my primary card.I'm not in the US. However, I'd recommend a rewards credit card. It's not difficult to reach the $1500 spend (which earns you the sign up bonus) in a few months and the Chase Freedom card seems like a no brainer.The Amex Blue Cash Everyday card is a solid choice. I've seen several people on the forum get a sign up bonus from this card recently. It seems like you have to apply directly from Amex's website to get one though, because if you apply through a referral link on this forum you don't get the sign up bonus.I'm using the Chase Freedom card right now. It seems like it's more flexible than the CSP, which I would want to have as my primary card if I wanted to use it a lot for business.I currently don't have any credit cards. However, I'm looking to apply for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card soon.I already have the Chase Freedom card and it seems pretty good.Right now, I don't have a credit card. I used to have the Chase Sapphire Preferred card for a few months, but then cancelled it because I didn't like the travel protections and customer service. I will probably get it again when the 5/24 rule ends and apply for another one.My current card is the Chase Freedom card, which seems like a good one. However, I'm not planning on opening another card any time soon, so I'm not sure what my primary credit card will be at that point.Currently I'm using the American Express Blue Cash Everyday card.I'm also looking to apply for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card soon, so it might become my primary card as well.I currently use the Chase Freedom card (the 3% category rotates, so I'm not sure if it would be worthwhile to switch).I've been using the Chase Freedom card, which is a good card for me. I don't travel or dine out often, so the travel/dining category doesn't mean much to me.I currently use the Chase Freedom card. I used to use the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, but decided I liked the Chase Freedom card better.I think the Chase Freedom card (3% cash back on rotating categories) would work best for me. I'm also going to apply for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card soon and will then need to decide whether I want that one or the Chase Freedom card to be my primary credit card.I'm currently using the Capital One Platinum card and have been for the last few years. I just recently got the card after I cancelled a similar card from another credit card company.I think the Chase Freedom card would be the best option for me right now. It seems like I could get a lot of value out of it and am interested in getting the sign up bonus.I'm using the Capital One Platinum card. I got this one because it's an introductory offer with a $0 annual fee and doesn't charge interest if you pay off the balance each month. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be using it though.My primary credit card is the Chase Freedom card.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card seems like a great option for me, but I'm still deciding on which one to choose.I'm currently using the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, which seems like a good option for me.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.For many years, I had an American Express Blue Cash Preferred card that I used for gas and grocery purchases. I had a $200 grocery spending bonus, an annual $100 statement credit for Uber rides, and a 1.5% cash back on everything I purchased, including gas, groceries, and restaurants.I would get $300 worth of cash back every year from the grocery bonus and an additional $100 cash back from Uber, which totaled $400 in cash back.However, if you're interested in applying for one, the cash bonus for 2023 is now only $200, and it is limited to $6,000 in grocery store purchases each year, or $12,000 per calendar year. I believe that Amex will do the same for the Uber credit this year.This year, Capital One announced that it would boost the $300 cash bonus for the Spark Card to $450 for grocery store purchases, which is higher than what Amex is offering.However, Capital One will limit the bonus to $12,000 in grocery store purchases, compared to $6,000 at Amex.The Cash Back Card from Chase also increased the $200 cash bonus to $400, and it will only apply to up to $10,000 in grocery store purchases per calendar year. I used to use a Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, which has an excellent sign-up bonus and annual fee reimbursement, and I think it's still a good card. However, the Sapphire Preferred Card will only provide up to $250 in bonus cash for groceries.My Capital One Venture X card gives me a sign-up bonus of 75,000 miles for $4,000 in new purchases in the first three months after account opening.This is more than double the amount offered by Amex, which offers 50,000 points. This is also double what Chase is offering with the Sapphire Preferred Card and the Sapphire Reserve.While Capital One's card will give me more points for my grocery spending, Amex's sign-up bonus will give me more points for my travel.The Capital One Venture X will not give me bonus miles for groceries, nor will it give me a yearly credit to offset the cost of airline tickets.I also have the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, which offers an annual $60 credit for any hotel stay booked through Chase.This is also a nice benefit for anyone who travels frequently.My Capital One Venture X card offers $100 in annual Uber Cash, as well as $300 in annual Capital One Travel credit.This card also offers 10x Capital One miles per dollar spent on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. I believe this card provides the best combination of benefits and perks.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. You're likely to be a heavy user of at least one credit card in your lifetime, so it makes sense to make the choice that will best suit your needs in the long run.For some, it could be a card with a lot of extra perks, such as rewards points, airline miles, or cash back. Other card users are looking for the card that provides the most savings. Still others are concerned with getting the best rate possible on their debt.The best choice will depend on your priorities, your credit history, and the card offers that are available to you.A rewards card will earn you points for the purchases you make with it. These points are often redeemable for a variety of perks. It could be a free trip, a gift card, or even a cash back check. The amount of points needed to redeem will depend on your point's value.Some reward cards are issued through a bank, but most are issued through major credit card companies. Some of these cards are affiliated with airline companies, and other cards are issued with partners such as grocery stores.Some of the best rewards cards in the market are also some of the most expensive cards, because the banks and card companies will offset their costs by charging you more in interest than they charge someone who is paying off their bill every month.If you're going to get a rewards card, it's best to do your homework first. Find out what kind of points the card gives you, how much the points are worth, and what it takes to redeem those points. If you have poor credit, you may want to choose a rewards card that offers a secured credit card with a low interest rate and minimal fees.Some cards provide a great rate, but they also require that you pay off your bill every month. If you don't, they will charge you a penalty fee. Some cards are designed to encourage you to pay off your balance every month, which is good if you can do so. But if you don't pay off your balance every month, they will charge you a penalty fee.Some people like to travel a lot, and that's a perk you'll find on some cards. If you're going to use your card for travel expenses, make sure it will get you the rewards you want.There are a lot of great credit cards out there.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I've recently made my first major purchases on my debit card instead of my credit card. Why? I have a balance on my credit card that I'm working on paying off before interest accrues, so I want to use that money to pay down my credit card debt. I'm also very much in favor of building good credit and avoiding high interest rates, so I'd rather use my debit card than my credit card.I'd love to hear how you go about deciding which credit card is best for you. Let's discuss!1. What's your best credit card?2. Why do you like that card?3. Why do you not use it more often?4. Why do you think most people choose to carry that card?I have the Capital One Venture card because I really like the 2% cash back on travel and restaurants, it's my favorite credit card I've had so far. I actually used it to book my recent trip to the US Virgin Islands on Travelocity. The 2% cashback was automatically credited to my Venture card and saved me a little bit of money on my trip.The one reason why I do not use it more often is because I've been carrying a balance on a different card and I'm working on paying it off so I've been avoiding the credit cards I have that are currently carrying a balance. I'd like to use the Venture card more often but I'm afraid of carrying a balance and paying interest.I think most people choose this card because it's very similar to other travel rewards cards so it's very user-friendly and easy to use. I'm guessing that most people that don't choose this card are people that are looking for a specific type of rewards card such as frequent flier miles or a hotel rewards card.I have been with Chase for 14 years and have the Premier rewards card. I like the flexibility in choosing how I redeem the points (travel or cash). And I am still under 30K so I haven't hit the tier where I would be penalized.I would probably use it more if it had the option of using it like a debit card. But as it stands, I don't trust myself not to go too far over the spending limit, so I don't use it.Most people choose it because it is very straightforward. The points and cash backs are pretty good. And it is widely accepted.I like my Capital One Venture Card for its 2% cash back and its 2x miles, with no annual fee. I only use it for travel, so it's super easy for me to track my spending and keep my rewards. No interest rate, so it's good for someone like me who is not a very good bill payer. I just don't use it too much because I'm not much of a shopper and I do use other credit cards for other things.The main reason most people choose it is because of the 2% cash back and the no annual fee.I use my Capital One card for travel. I have a 1% cash back card for regular everyday purchases and an SPC that is for everything else.My cash back card is good for everyday purchases, but I prefer to use the Capital One card for travel because you can earn extra miles on top of the 2% that you earn for travel expenses.I have the Chase Freedom Unlimited card with the 1.5% cashback and no annual fee. I only use it for groceries and travel. I use my regular credit card for everything else.I use it because it has no annual fee. And the cashback earnings are good.I think most people choose this card because it has no annual fee.I used to have the Capital One card when I was living in the US. But I cancelled that card and used the Chase card.I used to prefer the Capital One card because it was easier to use and you did not have to keep a minimum amount on your card to maintain it.With the Chase card, you need to keep a minimum amount in your account to avoid being penalized. I had this problem when I moved to Canada and had to change my credit card information with my online retailers. If you don't do it, then the credit card company will automatically cancel your card and close the account.I think that most people choose the Chase card because it is easier to use. I just prefer the Capital One card.I'm a Chase Sapphire Preferred cardholder, which has a 40,000 points sign-up bonus. I like it for travel rewards, which are 50% of the points redeemed for cash. So with my 40,000 point bonus, I've been able to travel for free to Europe and to Hawaii.I don't use the card more often because I like to use a credit card for all of my purchases and then just use my debit card at the ATM. I don't like carrying around a balance, so I just pay off the balance each month.The reason most people choose this card is because they get a 40,000 points bonus when they sign up and they can earn 2x points on travel and dining, which is the best category.I'm a Chase Sapphire Preferred cardholder, which has a 40,000 points sign-up bonus.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. As of now, the two cards that I have in my wallet are the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express and the Platinum Visa Card from Chase. The Blue Cash Everyday Card allows me to save 1.5% cash back on all purchases, and 6% cash back on up to $6,000 in combined grocery store and wholesale club purchases (such as Costco), 3% cash back at gas stations, and 1% cash back on all other purchases. The Platinum Visa Card offers a 0% introductory APR for 15 months on balance transfers and purchases, and has a $100 annual credit.Both credit cards are fantastic in their own ways. I would have a tough time choosing between the two of them because both cards have many great features, yet both cards also have drawbacks. It sounds like the best option for me would be to have two credit cards that both offer the best of both worlds, but unfortunately, such a card does not currently exist.Do you currently use one credit card exclusively? If so, what card do you use, and why do you believe that your card is the best option for you? If not, which card or credit cards do you use, and why do you like those cards?I currently have 4 credit cards. The main reason I have 4 is because I like the reward points that they each offer.First card - Capital One Platinum Rewards MasterCardThis card does not have an annual fee, and offers 1% cash back for every purchase that I make, which can be redeemed as gift cards for various retail stores. I use this card for groceries and any other purchases that I do not want to use my other cards for. The only drawback with this card is that there is a $0.50 fee for every ATM transaction that I use to get cash, and I find myself having to use my other credit cards to avoid paying that fee.Second card - PenFed Premium Travel Rewards MasterCardThis is the credit card that I use when I travel internationally. This card does not have an annual fee, and offers me the ability to earn 1.5% cash back on all purchases that I make. I do not use this card on a regular basis, but when I do use it, I can earn 1.5% cash back on all of my purchases while I am abroad.Third card - Capital One Venture Rewards Credit CardThis card is also the only credit card that I have that does not charge an annual fee. The main reason that I carry this card is because it allows me to earn 2 miles for every dollar that I spend on any type of purchase.Fourth card - Citibank Platinum Select World MasterCardI carry this card for the sign-up bonus that it offers, which is 50,000 bonus miles after I spend $3,000 during the first three months of having this card. This card also allows me to earn 50,000 bonus miles for making a single purchase at Best Buy or Bed Bath & Beyond during the first three months of having this card, so it offers some flexibility with the ways that I can earn miles on this card.My favorite feature of this card is the 0% introductory APR that it offers for purchases and balance transfers for 15 months, which is the longest 0% introductory APR that I have ever seen. I recently moved into a new house, and I wanted to use this card to make my home purchase with, because I will be able to save money if I do not have to make any monthly payments until the 0% introductory APR period ends.Overall, I find that each of the cards that I have works well for my purposes. The Capital One Platinum Rewards MasterCard is ideal for day-to-day purchases and is great when I need to use my credit card for a small purchase or a purchase that does not cost a lot of money. The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card allows me to earn miles on all of my purchases, which makes it ideal for traveling, while the PenFed Premium Travel Rewards MasterCard allows me to earn miles on all of my international travel purchases. The Citibank Platinum Select World MasterCard allows me to save money on interest payments if I ever need to transfer a balance or make a large purchase that will take me several months to pay off.</s>",

There's also an up to $100 credit on baggage fees when you redeem points.The Business Platinum Card is a top contender. With a $695 annual fee, it is more expensive than the Gold and Blue Business Plus cards, but offers far better value with a huge welcome bonus and lots of perks. The American Express Business Platinum Card also offers incredibly high bonus rates on certain purchases, which helps to make up for the high annual fee.The American Express Business Gold Card is currently the second most popular business credit card on the market. It offers the same perks and bonuses as the Business Platinum Card, but at a lower annual fee of $295.You'll earn 50,000 bonus Membership Rewards points after spending $10,000 on purchases within the first 3 months.

It's not great for businesses that spend a lot on office supplies and travel, though, because you'll only earn 2X points on those categories.The Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business offers 2 miles for every dollar spent on purchases, but only for the first $50,000 spent annually, after which you'll earn 1.25 miles per dollar.It also offers a 0% intro APR for 12 months from account opening, then 14.24% - 24.24% (V) thereafter.The Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business also offers up to $50,000 in bonus miles after spending $5,000 on purchases in the first 3 months.You'll get purchase protection of up to one year and extended warranties of up to one year.

You'll also earn 1X points for every dollar spent on other purchases.You'll also get 80,000 bonus points after spending $5,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.

You'll get a lower welcome bonus than the Ink Business Unlimited\u00ae Credit Card and Chase Ink Business Cash\u00ae Credit Card, though, and a higher APR after the introductory offer.The Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business is a great choice for businesses that travel frequently. You'll earn 2X miles for every dollar spent on travel and rental car insurance and 1X miles for every dollar spent on purchases.You'll get 0% intro APR for 9 months from account opening, then 14.24% - 24.24% (V) thereafter.You'll also get up to $100,000 in bonus miles after spending $5,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.The Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business is another solid choice that might be a better fit for businesses that do a lot of travel. You'll earn 2X miles on travel purchases, which is excellent for road warriors. However, it does cost more than the other cards listed above, because you'll have to pay an annual fee.The Chase Ink Business Cash\u00ae Credit Card is a good option if you're looking for a flexible and easy-to-use business credit card.You'll earn 5X points for every dollar spent at office supply stores, on cable, phone, and internet services, on travel purchases, and on purchases for advertising on social media and search engines.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I've been an avid user of my Chase Sapphire Preferred card for many years now, and I can't imagine using anything else. But my colleague, who writes for Forbes' Advisor and is a credit card expert, has some thoughts on the best card to choose for you based on your financial situation.Here's what he had to say:For people looking for a no-fee, low-interest-rate credit card to get them out of debt or put a dent in credit card debt, the Chase Slate card is tough to beat.The Chase Slate card has no annual fee and charges 13.99% interest for 15 months from when you open the account (that's 3.5 percentage points less than its nearest competitor, Discover It, which offers 17.24% interest for six months from account opening).After the initial 15 months, the APR climbs to a still-very-low 16.49% APR. That's a better deal than the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, which offers 16.49% APR from account opening (plus 19.99% for late payments) and the Citi Double Cash card, which charges 14.74% APR on balance transfers and 24.74% APR for cash advances.The card also has a low minimum-balance transfer amount of $15, which makes it easy to transfer $150 or $300 from a high-interest credit card account. Plus, there's a low late-payment penalty of up to $35.The Chase Slate card offers new cardholders a $0 intro balance transfer fee (then, 5% of each balance transfer; $5 minimum) and $0 intro foreign transaction fee (then, 3% of each transaction in U.S. dollars).\"The Chase Slate card is a fantastic tool to help manage debt and stay in credit card good standing, but I would like to see the company increase its rewards to make it worth the annual fee,\" said NerdWallet writer Adam McCann. \"The card earns two points per dollar spent on travel and dining, and one point per dollar on everything else. That's not a lot of value considering that other cards offer a higher return for everyday spending.\"Read the original article on DailyWorth. Copyright 2019.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. This is a common topic that's discussed amongst credit card enthusiasts and I'd love to know how your choice of card aligns with the best.Which Credit Card is Best for You?In case you're unfamiliar, I'll provide a quick breakdown of the three primary cards that I believe offer the most flexibility in terms of cash back perks, travel benefits, and low interest rates.Let's start with cash back. Most cash back credit cards fall into three general categories: those that offer flat rate cash back, those that offer rotating categories of cash back, and those that offer cash back for specific types of purchases. In the former group, you'll find cards like the Discover It, Citi Double Cash, and the Capital One Quicksilver. In the latter, you'll find the Chase Freedom Unlimited, Chase Freedom, Discover It, and the Chase Freedom Unlimited. And in the third group, you'll find cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred and the Chase Sapphire Reserve.Next, let's talk travel. Some cards are specifically designed for travel rewards. These cards include the Chase Sapphire Preferred and the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Other cards allow for travel perks like reimbursements for trip cancellations, rental car insurance, and complimentary hotel upgrades. These cards include the Barclaycard Arrival Plus, the Citi Prestige, and the Capital One Venture Rewards.Finally, let's talk low interest rates. Most credit cards offer a low introductory interest rate on new purchases and balance transfers. This rate is often around 0% for the first year but could last anywhere from 6 months to 24 months. These low interest rates are ideal for carrying balances from one month to the next or paying down high interest debt.So which card is best? Well, that depends on your financial goals and the kinds of purchases you make. If you want the best combination of rewards and low interest rates, I'd recommend the Chase Sapphire Reserve (for the 2x perks and 50,000 bonus points), the Chase Sapphire Preferred (for 1x rewards and 50,000 bonus points), and the Citi Prestige (for $250 in travel credit). If you want a card with the best low interest rates and the ability to earn cash back, I'd recommend the Capital One Venture Rewards. And if you want a card with the best combination of cash back and travel rewards, I'd recommend the Chase Freedom Unlimited and the Chase Freedom (for $150 in travel credit).Ultimately, the best credit card is the one that fits your lifestyle and aligns with your financial goals. So take some time to think about what matters most to you, then compare the available options to find the card that meets your needs.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. If you're in a rush, click here to find out which of these three cards we picked as the overall winner.I use the Chase Sapphire Preferred for almost all my travel related expenses. They have a 1 point/$1 for travel purchases so it's easy to rack up a bunch of points and redeem for a flight.As a small business owner with a lot of travel needs, I've had the Sapphire Preferred for almost 4 years now and I've never been charged a late fee or been over the credit limit. They send a text message whenever your statement is coming up, so if you happen to be a little busy on travel, there's no excuse for forgetting to pay your bill!I've also had a Visa Signature card for my car payments (Chase has a nice 1 point/$1 for gas too) and a Visa Cash Back card for all my grocery and dining expenses.The Cash Back has a nice 1 point/$1 rate but not for travel. However, I've found that most of the time I spend money at gas, grocery, and dining locations, so I'm not too concerned about using it for travel!Overall, Chase has the best customer service of any bank I've had.I use both Chase and Capital One credit cards.My Capital One Platinum MasterCard has been absolutely fantastic for me. I use it for all my everyday purchases and have had a very easy time building up my credit score. I recently moved into my first apartment, so I'm very happy to have a credit card in my name.I also got a Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card after seeing the commercial during the Olympics. I thought I was going to be disappointed with it, but the customer service is amazing! I called them about a problem I was having with my Sapphire Preferred and they actually offered me an upgrade from Preferred to Preferred Plus so I could get my card problems fixed and have an even better experience than if I hadn't called.The best part is that the customer service people are actually based in the US so I didn't have to deal with a bunch of automated menus and foreign call centers. It was also easy for me to set up the online account and redeem my reward points.There have been a few issues with the Sapphire Preferred card itself, but I've been able to call and get my problems solved quickly and without much hassle. I love Chase cards!</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I think that's the way to go. You can get 30,000 bonus points on the Discover It when you spend $500 within 3 months. That's 3 round-trip domestic economy class tickets if you redeem at 1.5 cents per point. The APR isn't as low, but that's OK as long as you can pay it off every month.I'm more of a cash back guy so I don't use any of the cards for that, but I do like the idea of getting rewards for a little extra money. But, it does make you spend a lot more money when using them, so I'm not sure if it's worth it or not.I like using a credit card for the benefits it gives you, like travel, entertainment, and others. However, you also have to take into account the interest rate on the card. My favorite card is a cash-back one.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I've recently started getting a lot of offers for credit cards. I think the reason is that I just had a pretty big expense: I bought a car. My credit is great (800+) and so I expect that I'll get a lot of credit offers. But which ones should I consider? I'm really only looking at the Chase and Citibank cards because I have them already, so I'm curious to hear about others.I recently switched from a Citi Gold to a Citi Platinum Select. I have been quite happy with this new card. The benefits of the card are as follows:Free FICO score update weeklyFour reward points for every dollar you spend on gasoline, airline tickets, car rentals, hotels, restaurants, etc.2X rewards points at supermarkets, drugstores, department stores, etc.Get one point for every dollar spent on all other purchasesComplimentary airline lounge access at over 400 locationsComplimentary travel accident insuranceComplimentary travel accident insurance for rental carsComplimentary emergency assistance servicesThis is really a very nice card. I'm considering switching back to Citi Gold because they're offering a $50 gift card to Costco, and that's a great deal. I guess I'll have to take a look at that offer more closely.I also have a Discover card. They've recently introduced a new 5% cashback program. This is a great offer for a credit card. The benefits are as follows:Get 5% cashback at select retailers every quarter. The offers are posted on a website.Get 1% cashback at all other retailersReceive $50 Cashback Bonus annuallyIf you purchase anything for $1,000 or more, they'll triple the cashback earned during the purchaseThis is a really great card. There's not much to say about the card, but I do recommend it. If you get it, then you're going to need to use it often. The benefits are great, but if you never use the card, then you're not getting your money's worth.I have also recently signed up for the Chase Freedom card. This card also has a great 5% cashback program. However, it's not a rotating cashback like the Discover card. You get 5% on everything all the time. You can also get 10% at certain retailers. For example, now at Home Depot, you can get 10% cashback on all purchases made at the store. So I've recently used this card to do a major purchase of a bed and some other furniture at Home Depot. I also recently used it to purchase a gift card at the Kmart gas station. I've also used it for gas purchases.One nice thing about the Chase Freedom card is that they have a 50,000 point signup bonus. However, this card has a pretty high interest rate if you don't pay it off every month. I've been trying to use the card as much as possible, so I can pay it off as quickly as possible. I also use this card for all my online purchases since I have their Safeway discount. This card is really a no brainer if you use it well. I'm considering applying for the Chase Sapphire card that has 50,000 bonus points, but that's another story for another day.So in short, my favorite credit cards are the Discover and Chase Freedom cards. They both have great benefits and a high cashback percentage.I also have a Chase Freedom and a Citicards with the Platinum Select. I find them both a bit of a pain and end up using them rarely if ever. It's not that they don't offer great benefits, it's that they're so darn complicated. It seems like every single offer and perk is tied to some kind of \"qualifier\" that you have to achieve before you actually get to use the benefit. So basically you're constantly trying to figure out what you've already qualified for and what you need to do next. I find it annoying.That being said, I love the concept of cashback credit cards and the Chase and Discover cards both offer good deals. I just prefer the Citi cards as they have a simple interface with no bells and whistles.I've used the Chase Sapphire Preferred card and I really like it. I have the Chase Freedom card too but I rarely use it, mostly because I find it so confusing. I'm considering the Discover More card. Have you used it? What's your opinion?The Chase Sapphire Preferred card is a great card if you like airline miles. They give you a lot of bonus miles when you sign up. Also, the miles they give you add up fast if you travel frequently. However, the card is pricey at $95 annually.The Discover More card has a good cashback program, but it doesn't really stand out compared to other cards. However, the card is a great introductory card and has no annual fee. It's really just meant for the person who doesn't want a lot of bells and whistles.I've used both the Discover More card and the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. I've always preferred the Chase card over the Discover card because of the free FICO scores. I also don't like the way Discover reports late payments. I always get a notice that I missed a payment, and the payment was actually due in 5 days. So that's a big negative for me.I also use a Chase Freedom card. I've used the Chase Freedom card and the Discover More card. Both are good. I use them in conjunction with a couple other cards that give me airline miles.So, I guess my question is, do you have a credit card that you prefer over the others?I love my Amex card. I've had the card for a long time, and I love the perks that it gives me. I love that they have the ability to give me free flights for just making purchases at certain stores. I also love that they offer a low interest rate if you pay off your balance every month. I don't have any complaints about the card.Well, that's my two cents on credit cards. Which one do you use? Why? I'd love to hear other opinions.I think it's great that there are so many options out there for people with good credit, but if you have bad credit, then your options are limited. So I'd like to hear about what other people with bad credit have to say about their experience getting a credit card.I've recently gotten several offers for Chase credit cards and I'm considering applying. They're offering a good rewards program and a $250 gift card to Target.The downside is that I have a lot of credit card debt. I have three cards with balances ranging from $150 to $1,500. I've been trying to pay off my cards as quickly as possible, but I haven't been able to do it.Do you have any advice for people who are trying to pay off their credit card debt? What's your experience with Chase?I recently applied for the Chase Sapphire card. I have never had a credit card, and I have good credit. I think it is a great card to have. They also have a rewards program that is quite generous. I haven't used it yet, but I plan to. The card has an annual fee of $75, and it offers $300 in rewards each year. If you use it well, you will get that back plus some.The Chase Sapphire card also offers a 0% APR introductory offer. You don't have to pay any interest for the first 12 months, and you also get 2% cash back on all purchases. The card has a lot of great features and is a great introductory card for people who want a credit card but don't have a lot of credit history.Do you have a credit card that you like? Which one do you use the most? Which one do you use the least?I have a Citi Platinum Select and a Capital One card. I've had both cards for over 10 years. I'm not a heavy user of either card, but I use both of them on a regular basis. I have the Platinum Select for emergencies and the Capital One card for everyday use.I also have a Chase Freedom card, which is a good cashback card. I don't have it right now, but I plan to apply for it again. I'm also considering applying for a Citi Double Cash card, which is another cashback card.Which card do you have? What do you like about it? What do you dislike about it?I have a Discover card and it is great. It is a no annual fee card that has a really nice rewards program. I think it is the best credit card I have ever had. The only thing I don't like is the interest rate, but I think it is pretty fair.I recently opened a new credit card account with Chase. I have a Discover card, but I decided to close it because I don't use it much. I was thinking about applying for a Chase card, but I've heard mixed reviews. So I'd like to hear from other people who have had experience with Chase.I'm looking for a good credit card with a lot of benefits. I have a Discover card and a Capital One card, but I think I'm going to close the Capital One card because I've heard it's not as good as the Discover card.What do you think of the Chase Freedom card? Do you like it? What are the pros and cons?I recently received a call from Chase Freedom. They offered me a free credit report and a $250 gift card to Walmart if I opened a Chase Freedom account. I'm thinking about it, but I don't really want to use this card. I've never had a credit card before and I'm not sure if I should get one or not.Which one should I get? What are the benefits of each card?If you're going to get a credit card, then it's best to get one with a low annual fee. The Chase Sapphire card has a low annual fee of $45, which is pretty good. It also has a 10% rewards program and a 0% APR introductory offer for the first 12 months.On the other hand, if you're going to get a cashback card, then it's best to get one with a low annual fee. The Discover More card has a low annual fee of $30. It also has a 10% rewards program and a 0% APR introductory offer for the first 12 months.What's your opinion? Do you prefer cashback cards or credit cards with a low annual fee?I've been thinking about getting a credit card, but I don't know which one is better.Do you think that a credit card with rewards is better than a credit card with no rewards?I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred and the Discover More cards. I've used both cards and I have to say that I like the Chase card better. It's a bit more user-friendly and the rewards are better.I also have the Chase Freedom card, but I don't use it because I don't like the rewards. I just think it's too much hassle.What do you think? Which card do you like better?Which card do you have? Which one do you prefer?I have a Chase Sapphire Preferred card. I like it because I can get free flights if I use it for purchases at certain stores. I also like that I don't have to pay any annual fees.The only thing I don't like is that I'm always getting offers for new credit cards. It's a bit annoying, but it's also helpful because I can use the offers to compare credit cards.I have a Chase Sapphire Preferred card, but I haven't used it much. I've never had any problems with it, and it's a great card to have. I like that it has a low interest rate, and I also like that it has no annual fee.I don't use it much, but I like that it gives me free flights if I use it for certain purchases. I also like that I don't have to pay any interest on my purchases.I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. I love it because it gives me 2X points on every purchase. I also like that I can use it for a variety of purchases, including travel and dining.The only downside is that it has a $95 annual fee. However, it's worth it because you get a lot of value for your money.I recently applied for the Chase Freedom card and I love it. It's the best credit card I've ever had. It's perfect for me because I love the 5% cashback program and I can use it anywhere. I'm also really happy with the 5X rewards program.The only thing I don't like about the card is that I have to pay an annual fee of $60. But it's worth it because I get so much value out of the card.I have a Discover card and I'm thinking about switching to a Chase card. I'm a little nervous because I've heard that the Chase Freedom card has a high interest rate. What do you think?I'm thinking of getting a credit card. I'm not sure which one to get, but I'm thinking of getting a Chase card. I know that I have bad credit and that I'm not very good at managing my finances. But I'm going to try anyway.I'm thinking that I'll get the Chase Freedom card. It has a low APR and a low interest rate. Plus, it has a great rewards program.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. If you have a favorite, please post your response. If you're a \"frequent flyer,\" I'd love to hear your preferred credit card, too.My primary credit card is a Bank of America Business Gold Rewards card with a low interest rate. I pay the balance off in full every month. I like it because of the rewards for purchases at specific merchants (3x points for travel, 2x for gas, 1x for everything else), low interest rate, and low annual fee.As for perks, the first thing that comes to mind is the credit card that came with the car. The manufacturer's perks include: free replacement car rentals, roadside assistance, and towing. That's definitely a perk I like and take advantage of.There are definitely many options. If you have any questions or concerns about which credit card to use for which situation, it might be a good idea to talk to a credit card counselor to see what he or she recommends.I have been looking into some credit cards that have some really good rewards and perks. I found one that is 0% for 12 months and you get 5% cash back. I will have to look into some more and see if I can get a better rate.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.If you don't have a credit card at all, I invite you to post your thoughts in the comments below.In other words, if you think it's best to stay away from credit cards, that's fine. But let's hear why you think so.I'm posting this question today because I've been reading a lot about credit cards in recent days, in part because of the announcement of the Citi Prestige card -- which has a host of outstanding perks.This has prompted some to say that this is yet another example of \"how to ruin your credit.\"But to me, that line of thinking makes no sense. For instance, the Citi Prestige card has a $450 annual fee. For that, you get $250 airline fee credit. That's pretty good.Plus, the card has $250 in annual travel credit and $100 in annual restaurant credit.These are just a few of the perks that are offered by the Citi Prestige card.I'll be curious to see if people will take this as an opportunity to bash the credit card industry.But if you're going to write a comment, I'd suggest using your real name, and sharing your thoughts.I believe that, in general, credit cards are the best way to go for most people. As long as you use the card responsibly and pay off your balance in full every month, the rewards are worth it.What do you think? Which card do you like? What do you hate?Please share your comments in the box below.I have both credit cards and debit cards, but I believe that credit cards are better for me. I do not feel the urgency to pay off the balance when I use a debit card, but when I use a credit card, it is more likely that I will pay the balance. I will have to see about the new Citi card. I have not looked at that particular card, but I like the ones that I have now. I am careful about how I use my credit cards. I only use them at reputable places, and I only spend what I can pay back in a timely manner. I do not want to use my credit cards to keep my credit score up. I need to maintain a high credit score for the time that I want to buy a home. I will keep reading about the new Citi card and I will see if it has any appeal for me.I currently have the Chase Freedom Card, which has no annual fee and the Chase Sapphire Preferred card which has a $95 annual fee. Both of these cards give me 5% on my grocery purchases and 2% on my other purchases. I do not have any debit cards. I think that if you use your credit cards properly then they are the better choice for you.I have always used credit cards and I have never had a problem with my credit score. I have a Citicard with a $10,000.00 line of credit, and I use this credit card for all of my expenses. I have never paid a fee on this card. I have a $3,000.00 balance, and it is paid in full every month, but I always have a balance on my card because I use it for all of my purchases. I do not use my credit card to build my credit. I just have never been very disciplined about paying my credit card balance in full every month.I used to be more reckless with my credit card use, but as I have gotten older, I am very cautious and try to pay my credit card balance in full every month. If I do not use my credit card for a couple of months, I call my credit card company and let them know that I will not be using the card for a period of time. This usually works out.We have both credit cards and debit cards. My husband is very responsible about his use of our credit cards, and he pays his balance in full every month. We have a debit card with a $5,000.00 limit on it, and we have not used it in several years. We use that card for ATM purposes, because we have automatic payments that are made every month with our checking account, and our credit card has a $10,000.00 limit on it, and we never use that card. We have never paid a fee on our credit card.I believe that if you can responsibly use your credit card and pay your balance in full every month, it is the better option for you, as opposed to using a debit card. If you are the type of person who does not have the discipline to pay your credit card balance in full every month, then a debit card is the better option for you.I have had the same card for about 5 years now. I am not sure if it is the best or not, but it has always worked well for me. It is a visa card. I use it for everything, and I pay it off every month. I have always been able to keep a good credit score. I use it because of the points I earn. It has been great to me. I have never had a problem with it. I have never had an issue with my credit card company because of this card. I do not have a problem with credit cards in general.I'm an amateur when it comes to credit cards, but I like the idea of a reward card where you earn points and can use them in exchange for things like gift cards, travel discounts, and airline discounts. That's what I have with Discover. I've had it for a couple years and I've gotten some great travel deals with it.I don't use my credit cards to buy things, but rather to get extra travel rewards and perks. I like how you can earn points and use them for discounts and other goodies. I've had my Discover Card for a while and I've had a good experience with them. I've also been able to earn points that I've used for free flights, free hotel stays, and other travel benefits. I've been really pleased with how much I've been able to travel with my Discover card and I've had a great experience with them. I wouldn't trade it for anything!I've had the same card since I was in college. I was so nervous about it at first because I didn't know what it was all about, but it's been great for me. I have my credit limit set at $5,000, and I use it for everything. I pay my balance in full every month, so I haven't paid any interest fees, and it's a really great card.I've never had a problem with it. I haven't been charged any fees either. I think that this is the best credit card out there. I've been with them for over 10 years, and I still love it. I can't see myself switching anytime soon.I've been with my credit card company for about 5 years now. I've never had any problems with them, but I don't use them much, and I don't use my debit card either. I always pay my balance in full every month, and I never pay any interest. I really like my card, and I haven't had any problems with it.I have a credit card that I've had for over 10 years. I've always paid my bill in full every month, and I've never paid any interest fees either. I've never had a problem with my credit card company. I'm really happy with my card, and I don't think there is a better one out there.I've been with my credit card company for a little over 5 years now.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.To the best of my knowledge, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is the most popular, with its 2% rewards bonus and 20% discount at certain restaurants (including Chipotle) among the perks. The AMEX Gold Card, meanwhile, is very popular among people who enjoy luxury experiences, as they're often given an invitation to special Amex events and such. I haven't seen many folks talk about the Blue Cash Preferred Card, though - that one is one of my favorites. It's best for people who spend a lot on groceries and restaurants, and it's worth looking into.If you've been in the industry long enough, you'll recall that the CSPC was pretty awful when it launched in 2006. Back then, it was the only card offering a rewards bonus of 2%, so there was a mad rush of folks trying to apply, and they were denied by the thousands. Then, Chase pulled an amazing, unprecedented coup, by offering to resell the cards to those who'd been rejected. The result was a massive surge in the credit card market. This may be worth looking into as a strategy, if you're not getting approved for the Sapphire Preferred Card (although I'm not sure how it'd work now that Chase has raised its credit standards).Chase recently changed the terms and conditions on their travel and entertainment rewards card, the AMEX Platinum Card. Now, they're cutting out a few of the perks, including 12 months of free airline lounge access.Chase has notified those with the AMEX Platinum Card that they have until June 1 to take advantage of the free airline lounge access. After that, those who still have the card will be notified about the new, lower benefits, including the removal of the Global Entry/TSA Precheck credit.If you have this card, now's a great time to call Chase and cancel it. The lounge access alone is worth far more than the 50,000 Membership Rewards points you'd earn from closing it.The AMEX Platinum Card offers 12 months of complimentary lounge access. The card also comes with an exclusive concierge service, and it offers double Membership Rewards points on travel. The card itself, though, carries an annual fee of $450 (or $550 for the version with lounge access).To give you an idea of how valuable this card is, you'd have to earn 66,700 Membership Rewards points from spending on your card in the next 12 months in order to receive the full value of the $550 lounge access fee. You'd also have to spend $11,100 on travel in order to earn the same value.You might be able to save even more on this card if you call and cancel it. Just make sure you do so before you hit 12 months.If you're looking to sign up for an Amex card to boost your credit score, you might want to avoid signing up for the Blue Cash Preferred Card.When I applied for the Blue Cash Preferred Card last year, I was instantly rejected. According to some online forums, this has happened to others, too. If you're having the same issue, you can call in and ask for a personal loan from Amex, but I haven't heard if this actually works.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I'm currently looking at the Barclays US Airways, Capital One, Citi Hilton, and the Chase Ink cards.I am leaning towards the Chase Ink because it has no annual fee and offers 3 points for every dollar spent in office supply stores and travel (and 2 points for every other dollar).Any other cards that I should consider? Any suggestions on where to apply?If you aren't interested in getting a travel rewards card, but simply want cash back, the Chase Freedom is an excellent card. They have a great rewards structure and offer very high cash back rates for many types of purchases.The Capital One Venture Card and Barclays US Airways Card are travel rewards cards that also offer cash back at gas stations. The Chase Freedom also offers cash back at gas stations, but I personally find the Barclays and Capital One cards to offer more cash back for gas purchases.I personally prefer to avoid the Barclay US Airways Card. US Airways is one of the worst airlines out there, and there is no way to actually redeem any miles.The US Airways card does earn \"Dividends\", which can be used for shopping at US Airways's website. However, if you ever leave US Airways to fly another airline (like Alaska Airlines, which I happen to frequent), you will be stuck with US Airways miles you can't use. You will never be able to use those miles on another airline.I like both the Chase Ink Card and the Capital One Venture Card.The Chase Ink Card offers 3 points for every dollar spent on office supply stores and travel, as well as 2 points for every other dollar.The Capital One Venture Card offers 2 points for every dollar spent and an additional 50,000 bonus miles if you spend $5,000 in the first three months.The Chase Ink Card and the Capital One Venture Card are both excellent cards. The Capital One Venture Card, however, offers a slightly higher return.I like the Chase Ink Card as well. The Chase Ink offers three rewards points for every dollar spent on office supply stores and travel. The Capital One Venture Card offers 2 points for every dollar spent.I like the Chase Ink Card. The Capital One Venture Card is also an excellent card, and both offer 2 points for every dollar spent. The Chase Ink Card is a better card for business owners, but either card is a good choice for business travelers.The Chase Ink Card offers 3 points for every dollar spent on office supply stores and travel. The Capital One Venture Card offers 2 points for every dollar spent.I like the Chase Ink Card as well. The Capital One Venture Card is an excellent card, and both offer 2 points for every dollar spent.I am going to recommend the Chase Ink Card. The Capital One Venture Card offers a higher rate of return for the first three months, but that will soon go away, and after that, the Chase Ink Card offers the same 2 points for every dollar spent.There are several advantages to having both cards. With the Chase Ink, you can earn 200,000 additional miles if you spend $1,000 every month for six months. With the Capital One Venture Card, you can earn 50,000 additional miles if you spend $5,000 within three months.Both cards offer a high return on spending and rewards. The Capital One Venture Card offers the higher rate of return on spending for the first three months, but after that, the Chase Ink Card offers the same 2 points for every dollar spent.I like the Chase Ink Card because it has no annual fee and offers 3 points for every dollar spent in office supply stores and travel.The Capital One Venture Card also has no annual fee and offers 2 points for every dollar spent, but the Chase Ink Card is a better choice if you travel frequently.The Barclays US Airways Card has an annual fee of $89, but there are no rewards to earn with this card.The Capital One Venture Card offers a 0% introductory interest rate for the first year, but that rate will then go up to 18.24%.The Chase Ink Card does not have an annual fee, but there are rewards you can earn. For example, the Chase Ink Card offers three rewards points for every dollar spent on office supply stores and travel, as well as two rewards points for every other dollar spent.The Capital One Venture Card is a very good choice for those who travel frequently and do not want to pay an annual fee. However, if you are not interested in travel rewards and just want a cash back card, the Chase Freedom is the better choice.I'm a big fan of the Chase Ink. They offer three points for every dollar spent on office supply stores and travel. The Capital One Venture Card offers 2 points for every dollar spent.The Chase Ink has no annual fee and offers a 0% introductory interest rate on purchases and balance transfers.The Capital One Venture Card also has no annual fee, but it does offer a 12.99% - 21.99% introductory interest rate on purchases and balance transfers.The Chase Ink is better for business owners, but the Capital One Venture Card is better for those who travel frequently and want to earn rewards for their spending.I recommend both cards.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I think I have my answer, but I'd like to hear yours.I don't often find myself in the position to answer questions, but one I received the other day compelled me to do so.I think the credit card I mentioned in the question is the best in many ways, but it may not be best for everyone. There are several credit cards out there that are good for different reasons.It is the American Express Gold Card.First off, I think this card is a great choice for those who travel regularly and plan to earn Membership Rewards\u00ae Points.In order to earn the most points, you need to spend $5,000 in purchases on your card each calendar year, and you need to be traveling in the first and/or business class section of a flight.This means that, unless you are flying internationally first or business class, you won't be earning points at full capacity.Further, the points you earn can be redeemed for almost any type of travel, including flight tickets, hotel stays, car rentals, and more. The more points you accumulate, the more flexible they will be in terms of what type of travel you can book.The American Express Gold Card has a yearly fee of $175, which is a bit more than the average credit card.This card is only available for those who have a good to excellent credit score.If you are an eligible applicant and you meet the requirements, you will be able to earn one point for every $1 you spend.I don't think you should necessarily use your credit card to earn points. You should be careful to only use it to make purchases you would normally make. If you don't have a travel budget, it's best to set aside money for your trip.If you are not traveling often, the best option may be the American Express Everyday\u00ae Preferred Credit Card, which I'll discuss below.This is the only American Express card you can apply for without an invitation. However, it may be harder for those with a limited credit history or with a low credit score to qualify for.You can also earn one point for every $1 you spend, but you will need to spend $1,000 in purchases within the first three months.The downside to this card is that it only comes with two airport lounge accesses per year.The American Express\u00ae Green Card is a good choice for those who are not looking to earn Membership Rewards Points and want to save a bit of money while traveling.This card offers a welcome bonus of $100 for every $1,000 you spend in the first three months.You also earn one point for every $1 you spend, but your points do not expire if you are not traveling much.The downside to this card is that you may have a higher interest rate than other credit cards.I don't think the American Express\u00ae Green Card is the best choice for most people. I would recommend that you look for cards that offer better perks and lower interest rates, as they may help you pay less in the long run.This is the card that offers the best overall value.You'll earn 2 Membership Rewards\u00ae points for every $1 you spend on the card, and you can earn points in any airline or hotel.You can earn one point for every $1 you spend, and you will be able to redeem your points for airfare, hotel stays, and more.You will earn 1.5 points for every $1 you spend on your purchases.The American Express Gold Card has the lowest interest rate of any card.The American Express Gold Card is the best choice for anyone who is looking for the best value.I think that the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae is the best overall card for most people.However, it may not be the best for those who are just starting out.The Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae offers a welcome bonus of $300 for every $4,000 you spend in the first three months.This is the only card that comes with an annual fee of $450.This is the only card that offers an introductory rate of 0% APR for the first 12 months.You'll earn two points for every $1 you spend on the card, but you will also earn one point for every $1 you spend in the first three months.You'll earn 1.5 points for every $1 you spend on the card.This is the only card that comes with travel benefits, which include a complimentary Delta SkyMiles\u00ae companion certificate and a $300 statement credit.The Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae has a lower interest rate than other cards. It is the best choice for those who are looking to earn points and save money while traveling.I think it is worth it to get a credit card that offers perks and low interest rates.I would recommend that you read my post, \"What is a Good Credit Score,\" to learn more about how to use a credit card responsibly.In order to earn the best rewards possible, you need to be traveling in first and/or business class. If you are not, you can only earn a small amount of points.If you are traveling in the first and/or business class section of a flight, you will be able to earn points at the full capacity.You can also earn one point for every $1 you spend.The American Express Gold Card is the best choice for those who are looking for the best value.It has the lowest interest rate of any card and is the best choice for those who are just starting out.I think that the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae is the best overall card for most people.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. What do you like most about your credit card?My personal favorite is the Barclaycard Arrival World MasterCard because it offers 5x the points on purchases made directly from the airline and hotel partners, 2x on other purchases and 1x everywhere else. And because it has no foreign transaction fee I use it in a variety of foreign countries. The card has also given me a great cash back on numerous occasions.It offers a low introductory interest rate (if you qualify), and the flexibility to use the points for any purchase you choose, and redeem them for travel. I would have to say I love my Chase Freedom Card for that reason. I can easily transfer my points to a variety of travel partners, and the points never expire.It's the first time I used a credit card online, and it was good, I like it. I'm happy with the Chase Freedom card for online purchases because I got 10,000 points in 3 months just from using the card for my purchases and paying my bill on time.</s>",

I can't emphasize enough the importance of having credit. It helps you secure a loan when the time comes, as well as help you build a positive credit history.We've reviewed the best credit cards for the average consumer, as well as those who have a higher than average income and want more from their credit cards.So, in that spirit, I'll introduce you to the three credit cards I think are the best, as well as what you need to consider when choosing a credit card.Amazon has become the online retailer of choice for millions of consumers. The site has made shopping easy and provides a massive selection of products from all over the world.Amazon has its own Amazon Prime Rewards credit card that gives you the best perks when shopping with Amazon. If you're an avid Amazon user, consider getting this card. It allows you to earn 5% back on Amazon.com purchases, 2% back on gas, restaurants, and drugstores, and 1% on everything else.You will also enjoy free shipping for two days on purchases of $35 or more.You don't need to be an Amazon Prime member to get this credit card.Another perk of the Amazon Prime Rewards credit card is it has no foreign transaction fees.The card is issued by Chase.If you're a food lover, consider getting the Chase Sapphire Reserve. The Chase Sapphire Reserve gives you 3X points on travel and dining at restaurants and a 100,000 point sign-up bonus after you spend $4,000 within the first three months.This perk is only available if you spend $4,000 in the first three months. You also need to pay an annual fee of $450 each year.Chase Sapphire Reserve is also offering 50,000 bonus points if you spend $4,000 within the first three months. If you spend $10,000 within the first three months, you'll receive 100,000 bonus points.You'll also receive a free $300 credit for travel.If you prefer to shop at Macy's, you can get a credit card from Macy's and reap the benefits of the Macy's Star Rewards Credit Card.It has no annual fees.If you're wondering what other perks you'll enjoy, the card also gives you 2% cash back on purchases at Macy's, and 1% back on purchases at gas stations, department stores, and drugstores.If you're looking for a flexible credit card that gives you the freedom to pay for whatever you want, then consider the Wells Fargo Platinum Visa Card.This credit card is a great starter card if you don't have much credit.You also don't have to worry about any fees because it has no late fees, annual fees, or foreign transaction fees.This credit card can be a great tool to help you build credit. It reports to all three major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax).There are two credit cards that I don't recommend if you're trying to build credit. I recommend you avoid the Capital One Platinum and Blue Cash Everyday credit cards.If you're considering applying for these credit cards, you'll enjoy a $0 annual fee, a $0 balance transfer fee, and a $0 foreign transaction fee. But, you won't earn a high interest rate, and you won't receive any perks.There is no minimum credit score for any of these cards.When choosing a credit card, I recommend you read the terms of the offer. There may be things you won't like, such as a high APR or no rewards, for example.I encourage you to choose a credit card with a low APR. If you don't, it'll cost you more money in the long run. The APR will determine how much interest you'll pay, so the lower your APR, the less you'll have to pay.You should also consider what the card's credit limits are and how it affects you.If you know your credit score, make sure the credit card is within your credit limit.If it isn't, then you should consider getting a credit card with a higher limit.You may also want to check how much the interest rate is if you decide to carry a balance.When choosing a credit card, you should also know that you need to pay off your credit card bill in full each month.If you do this, you won't have to pay any interest.Also, you should avoid spending more money than you have. If you do, then you will start accruing interest.Don't forget that each time you swipe your card, you're charged a transaction fee. This fee can be as high as 3%.If you don't want to be charged the transaction fee, then choose a credit card with a low interest rate.Credit cards can be great tools to help you build credit and pay for things. You should carefully choose the best credit card that fits your needs and budget.What Credit Cards Do You Have?Which card do you have? Are there any perks you don't like?

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I personally use the Discover It card because I am a student and can't pay my balance off each month but I would still like to earn rewards. They also have one of the best zero percent introductory rates I've seen so far (18 months.) The Citi Double Cash card and Citi Hilton HHonors also seem to be well received but I'd like to know more specifics on how their benefits compare.Any advice would be appreciated. I'm inexperienced with credit cards so please be gentle.This may or may not be helpful, but here is a link to an article on one of the popular credit card comparison sites. They have some pretty good tools for searching for the best cards for any given person.One thing to watch out for with the rewards credit cards is to not have it tied to too many recurring charges (like Netflix, etc.) which may keep you in credit card debt. I've found that I can just make one payment a month, or do a balance transfer if I need to and then get the card paid off.I use a rewards card because my wife is the one with the good credit and I'm not. I don't want to pay interest but I do like the rewards. My rewards have been less than ideal so I'm looking into the Discover card as well. I used to have a Capital One card. I liked it but when I got laid off, I didn't pay it on time. The next day they sent my credit rating plummeting by about 100 points. My rewards got eaten up when I paid the balance off but I was able to build my credit back up in time for me to get a loan to buy my house.Another thing to watch out for with some of these cards is the cash advance fee. For example, my Capital One card is only $10 to use it like a debit card, but there's an additional $5 if you take out cash.Yeah, I've looked at a lot of the rewards cards. I don't know if it's just marketing to get me to apply, but a lot of the terms are kind of misleading. I've seen a few with 15.99% APR and then the next line has 22.99% APR. A lot of the cash advance fees are pretty insane as well. I don't understand why they can't make the APR consistent across the board.I have the Citicard because I have a lot of experience with it and I know how to use it wisely. I have the Visa Gold because I get $400 in airline miles each year and the $1000 credit line that goes along with it. I just got the Discover IT because I found that the $500 credit line was a great amount for me to have to start my credit off right. I don't think I'll be able to apply for a real credit card until my score is higher.There's the Citibank Rewards Plus card. You earn 1 point per dollar spent, there's no annual fee, and there are no foreign transaction fees. Points are redeemable for cash back, gift cards, or travel. There are some pretty decent rewards (up to 3x points in some cases) and there's no balance transfer fee. There are also a ton of other great features that the website shows you.The Chase Freedom Visa card is also great. The current intro APR is 0% APR for 15 months on balance transfers and purchases. There's no balance transfer fee, no annual fee, and the current point rate is 1 point per dollar spent. The point rate also fluctuates monthly, so make sure you check the website before signing up.Also, if you have a Barclay's MasterCard, it may be worth keeping. I had one of these and it was my first \"real\" card. I used it all the time and never had an issue. It's not the best card out there, but it's definitely a good starter card.I'd love to get a Capital One card, but it looks like I have a hard time getting approved. I know it's not great to go on the phone with them, but I'm hoping it'll help my odds of getting approved for the Capital One 360. It's a solid card, with a nice feature set and competitive APR.A friend of mine has one, I don't know if I can go as far as saying he's been happy with it, but he's happy with it.Yeah, it seems like it's pretty solid. I haven't heard much about it though. I guess it's just not as advertised.I have one, I've been happy with it. It's a little more than the other cards, but that's about it.Thanks for the advice, everyone. I'm definitely keeping my eyes open for the Citicard, Visa Gold, and Discover cards. I've already gotten a Capital One card, but I don't think I have enough credit to qualify for their other products. I'm just looking for a way to build my credit, get some rewards, and keep my cash in the bank instead of having to pay off credit cards every month. I've been getting pretty good at the budgeting and managing my money side of things, but I need to step up the credit game.I've had the same credit cards as you for the last two years now. They're all great cards and I'm very happy with them.It really depends on what you're looking for. Capital One and Discover tend to have better rewards, but lower credit lines. I would say if you want the best rewards and credit lines, get the Citicard. If you want a low APR, get the Visa Gold. And if you want good rewards with a high credit line, get the Discover. But there are so many cards and options out there that it's hard to say which one is the best.I have the Barclaycard, the Citibank Rewards Plus, the Discover IT, and the Chase Freedom Visa. I use my Barclaycard the most, as I have a really high credit line on it and I'm able to make a lot of really big purchases.I also have the Citibank Rewards Plus and Discover IT, and I think I'm going to cancel my Citibank card. The Chase Freedom Visa card is also a good card, but it has a really high balance transfer fee. I've done it once, and it was really expensive.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.My best credit card is the Capital One Venture Rewards credit card. Capital One's 1.25% cash-back rate for everyday purchases is pretty much unbeatable (I just got $300 cash for a Capital One credit card purchase). I also love the fact that I can get a one-time bonus of 10,000 miles if I spend $2000 in the first three months (that's about $250 in cash).I've been really happy with my American Express Blue Sky credit card because it offers a zero percent balance transfer rate for the first six months of use. After that, I will have to decide whether or not to switch to a lower rate credit card or start paying interest on my balances.But I don't think that either of these credit cards is really the best option for me, because neither one offers any rewards for my everyday purchases. The best option for me would probably be something like a Barclaycard cashback card, which gives you $20 back on each $100 spent, but I've been a little afraid to use one of those because of the possible fees.What kind of credit card do you use and why do you think it's the best?The best combination of benefits is a Visa Platinum credit card from a credit union, which offers a 0% rate on purchases for up to 18 months and cash back rewards on gas and groceries.I think you should ask yourself these questions before you decide which card to choose:-What are my financial goals?-What is my budget?-How much do I pay in interest each month?-How much do I have saved up?A credit card that offers 0% APR may be the best option if you need to make a large purchase that you can't pay off right away. If you have a high balance, then it's probably better to go with a card that offers rewards for every dollar spent.What I like about the Capital One card is that it's pretty easy to earn rewards. The only thing I don't like about it is that there's no way to redeem them for cash back or travel points.The American Express Blue Cash Everyday card is a great choice if you want to earn cash back on your everyday purchases. The only thing I don't like about it is that there's no way to redeem rewards for gift cards or travel points.The best credit card is the one that best fits your lifestyle.If you travel often, then it makes sense to get a travel rewards card that gives you miles or points for every dollar you spend. If you want to earn cash back on your everyday purchases, then it makes sense to get a card that offers cash back rewards.The American Express Blue Cash Preferred card is the best choice if you want to earn cash back on your everyday purchases, but there's no way to redeem rewards for travel points or gift cards.My best credit card is the Discover card because it offers a low interest rate and no annual fee. Plus, it gives me 5% cash back on all purchases made through the website. I don't have any other credit cards, but I use this one for everything except gas and groceries. I just recently got a Capital One card and it's been great!I'm still using my Amex Blue Cash Preferred card. It has a low interest rate and no annual fee, plus it gives me 5% cash back on all purchases made through the website.The best credit card I've ever had was a Bank of America credit card. It offered a low interest rate, no annual fee, and it gave me 5% cash back on all purchases made through the website.I think the best credit card is the one that gives you the most benefits. For me, that's the Discover it Miles card because it has no annual fee, gives me 5% cash back on all purchases made through the website, and it's the only card that allows me to earn 2% cash back at gas stations and grocery stores.The best credit card is the one that offers the most perks.The best credit card is the one that fits your lifestyle and your budget.I use the Capital One Venture Rewards card because it offers a low interest rate, no annual fee, and it gives me 2 miles per dollar spent on all purchases made through the website.If you're looking for a good balance transfer offer, then I recommend the Discover it Miles card.The Capital One Venture Rewards card is the best credit card I've ever had because it offers a low interest rate, no annual fee, and it gives me 5% cash back on all purchases made through the website.I like my Capital One card because it offers a low interest rate, no annual fee, and it gives me 5% cash back on all purchases made through the website.What's the best credit card to get a 0% APR offer?</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.My vote would go to the AMEX Hilton Honors American Express Surpass. Aside from the 125,000 Hilton Honors points welcome bonus, you also get 12x Hilton Honors points per dollar spent at Hilton, 7x Hilton Honors points per dollar spent at restaurants, and 5x Hilton Honors points per dollar spent on airfare purchased directly from an airline. Those bonus points would be quite valuable at hotels like the Wynn Las Vegas or a Hilton hotel in Hawaii.The AMEX Hilton Honors Surpass Card has a 0% intro APR for 15 months from the date of account opening, which is ideal for purchases that require a lengthy financing period. However, this offer is only available to new cardholders. It also includes no foreign transaction fees, which means there will be no foreign transaction fees whatsoever. This includes when you use your card in places like Australia or Europe. And there's no annual fee.The one downside is that the AMEX Hilton Honors Surpass Card doesn't have a sign-up bonus that's anywhere near as high as some other offers, like those you might see with cards like the American Express\u00ae Gold Card. But it's a very well-rounded card overall that earns a lot of rewards in multiple categories.The best credit cards for frequent fliers, in my opinion, are the Chase United\u2120 Business Card and the AMEX Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant\u2122 American Express\u00ae Card. They both offer bonus points in the 5x to 6x range when you spend money on airline tickets, so you'll get the most bang for your buck.With that said, the Chase United\u2120 Business Card's welcome bonus is higher \u2014 100,000 United miles after you spend $5,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. The card also has an annual fee of $95 and no foreign transaction fees, which means you won't be charged any extra for using your card abroad.You'll also earn 2x points per dollar spent on purchases at restaurants, and 1 point per dollar spent on all other purchases. Those points can be redeemed for travel on United or any of its partners, or for cash back.The AMEX Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant\u2122 American Express\u00ae Card, meanwhile, comes with a 75,000 Marriott Bonvoy\u00ae points welcome bonus after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. Like the Chase United\u2120 Business Card, this card also has an annual fee of $95 and no foreign transaction fees. You also get 6x points at Marriott hotels and at restaurants on up to $15,000 in combined purchases each year. And like the United card, this one also comes with two travel benefits that are very convenient.One is a free night certificate each year after you charge $60,000 worth of purchases to your card in a calendar year. And the other is airport lounge access for you and up to 2 other guests on the same reservation.I don't think that this is an easy decision, because I think there are pros and cons to both. But I will say that if you use a lot of rideshares, then the Chase Ink Business Preferred\u2120 Credit Card may be more ideal for you. It gives you 3x points per dollar spent on travel, shipping, internet, cable, and phone services.This is a good card to get for people who have a lot of expenses in these areas, like if you spend a lot on phone, internet, and cable services. The 3x points per dollar spent is especially good because if you combine it with the 1x point per dollar spent on everything else, then you can effectively earn 3x points per dollar spent on everything.With that said, I like the Chase Ink Business Preferred\u2120 Credit Card for other reasons as well, like the 0% intro APR for 12 months from account opening on purchases. This is a great perk if you need to finance a large purchase and don't want to pay interest charges.It also has no foreign transaction fees, which means there will be no additional costs when you travel abroad. There is also no annual fee and it includes free employee cards.I think that this is the card that offers the best welcome bonus. That's because you can earn 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae points after you spend $15,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.The Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae program is also very flexible and versatile because you can easily transfer your points to many of Chase's airline and hotel partners, or for cash back.What type of points and miles are the best to earn?The type of points and miles you should earn really depends on your travel habits.If you like to travel domestically, then the best rewards points program for you may be the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card. That's because it offers 2 points per dollar spent on all travel and dining purchases.The Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card is also ideal for people who like to travel internationally. That's because it gives you 2 points per dollar spent on all travel and dining purchases and 1 point per dollar spent on everything else.The Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card also has an easy-to-use app, which is good for people who like to plan their travel. The app includes a lot of information about where you can travel, and it's really convenient.If you travel internationally a lot, then the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae card may be ideal for you. It offers 3 points per dollar spent on travel and dining purchases, and you can use those points to book free travel on any of Chase's airline and hotel partners. This card also has no foreign transaction fees, which means there will be no extra costs when you travel abroad.Another great feature is the annual travel credit, which reimburses you up to $300 each year for travel purchases like airline tickets, hotel stays, rental cars, and more.If you like to spend money on entertainment and dining out, then the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card may be ideal for you. It offers 2 points per dollar spent on all travel and dining purchases and 1 point per dollar spent on everything else.If you're looking for a simple way to earn travel rewards, then I think the best card for you is probably the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae card. It gives you 1.5% cash back on everything and no annual fee.The other cards on this list are much more complex, and some have higher annual fees. The Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae card is easy to use and it comes with a welcome bonus of $200 after you spend $500 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. This card also gives you 15 months from account opening to earn 0% intro APR on purchases.This means that you can use the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae card to finance any large purchase and not have to pay interest charges on it.What type of credit card is the easiest to use?The easiest credit card to use is probably the Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card. It has no annual fee, so it's easy to maintain.This card also offers a 0% intro APR for 12 months from account opening on purchases, so you can finance any large purchase and not have to worry about paying interest charges.The Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card also gives you 2 miles per dollar spent on all purchases. This is a good perk because you can use your miles to book free travel on any of Capital One's airline and hotel partners. You can also transfer your miles to over 15 different frequent flyer programs.What type of rewards card offers the best overall value?This depends on your spending habits.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.A lot of credit cards are offering cash back on different purchases, like groceries or gas. Some of them offer points on travel or purchases at wholesale clubs like Costco or Sam's Club. Others allow you to earn more rewards in a certain category. If you spend a lot of money on restaurants, for example, a cash back card might not make sense for you because it would be hard to find a better deal elsewhere.Some people like to use their credit cards as debit cards when they don't have enough money in their checking account. They just pay off their monthly statement each month, so they never accrue any interest or fees.Others use their credit cards for emergencies, such as paying for an unexpected medical bill. They carry a balance on their card to cover the cost of the bill and then pay off the balance over time.The interest rate on a credit card is the percentage of your balance that you have to pay for borrowing money. This can be very high, especially if you have a bad credit history. The interest rate can vary from one company to another, so it is important to compare different cards before making your decision.The annual fee is the cost of owning the card. It may be a percentage of the total value of your balance, or it may be a flat fee. Annual fees vary by card and you can usually avoid them by paying off your balance each month.Cash back rewards are a common perk for many credit cards. Cash back programs allow you to earn a certain percentage of your purchases as cash, which can then be used to pay off your credit card balance or apply to other purchases. Cash back programs are generally offered on a tiered basis, with higher rewards earned for certain spending categories such as groceries and gas.A rewards program is a perk offered by many credit cards that allows you to earn rewards points or cash back on purchases. These rewards can be used to pay for future purchases or even put towards your balance.The best rewards program for you will depend on your spending habits and what you're looking for in a credit card. Some rewards programs offer more flexibility than others, so be sure to research the terms and conditions before signing up for one.Some of the most popular rewards programs include:Chase Sapphire Preferred: 3x points on travel and dining, 2x points on all other purchasesCapital One Venture Rewards: 2x points on travel and dining, 1.5x points on all other purchasesAir Canada Aeroplan: 2x miles on travel and dining, 1x mile on all other purchasesIf you're like most people, your credit card is your primary form of payment. But what happens when you lose your card? And how can you get it back?Losing your credit card can be a very frustrating experience. You might have trouble paying for things without it and may even have to cancel some of your plans. If you're lucky, you might find your lost card in a place you didn't expect. But what happens if you can't find it?The first thing to do is to call the customer service number on the back of your card. They will likely be able to help you get a new one or at least provide some information about where your old one was lost. You should also check with your bank or credit union if they offer replacement cards.If all else fails, there are other options available to you.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.If you have a credit card in mind, please let me know about it, and I will include your comment in a future blog. If you'd prefer, you can leave your comments privately and let me know that's the case.Here's mine: The Capital One Venture card is my favorite, for many reasons. First of all, there's no annual fee. Second, you can earn double miles on every purchase you make, and these miles have no blackout dates.So, you can go on vacation any time of year and get double the miles for that trip! That's a big plus.The card is easy to get, and even if you don't have a stellar credit record, it's worth applying for.Their customer service is top-notch, too.Anyway, tell me about yours, and I will share it with my readers. Thanks!I currently have the Discover card. I think they're excellent, although my husband still hasn't quite adjusted to the fact that I was the only one allowed to use it at first. But then again, I'm the one who paid it off each month.Hi Susan. I have two credit cards, and both are Discover cards. I've had both since college. I am a little bit on the nervous side when it comes to credit cards and that's why I like Discover. I can put in a phone call and the person who answers my call is always from the USA. They know what's going on with my card and I always feel in good hands. I like that!</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I've narrowed down some of the best credit cards available in 2019.The Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card is one of the best travel rewards credit cards on the market, offering 2x points on dining and travel purchases. These rewards can be redeemed for a wide range of travel and dining expenses. Plus, the card offers 0% APR on purchases for the first 12 months.The Ink Business Preferred\u2120 Credit Card is an excellent option for small business owners looking to maximize their rewards on travel and business purchases. The card offers 3x points on the first $150,000 spent in combined purchases of travel and office supplies each account year, along with a 0% intro APR on purchases for the first 12 months.The Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card is one of the best travel credit cards because it offers up to 100,000 bonus miles when you spend $5,000 on purchases within the first 3 months of account opening. The card offers an ongoing 2x miles per dollar spent, along with 0% APR on new purchases for the first 15 months.For those who want a cash-back card, the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae offers a nice sign-up bonus and an intro APR for new purchases. You'll earn an additional 1.5% cash back on every purchase in your first year of account opening, plus 5% back on rotating categories each quarter up to $1,500 in combined purchases.The Capital One\u00ae Quicksilver\u00ae Cash Rewards Credit Card is a no-frills cash-back card. There's a bonus for new cardholders, but it's just $150 compared to the $100, $150, and $150 you could get with the above cards. The card also offers a nice intro APR on purchases for the first 15 months.While the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae offers an enviable travel rewards program, it's definitely not for everyone. The annual fee is a hefty $450 and there's an upfront bonus you can earn with the card.In order to get the Chase Sapphire Reserve's 50,000 bonus points, you need to spend $4,000 on purchases within the first 3 months of account opening. While that's not a huge expense for some, it might be too much for others.The card's other perks include a $300 travel credit per year, the ability to transfer rewards to hotel and airline loyalty programs, and 3x points on travel and dining purchases.While there are many great credit cards available in 2019, it's important to remember that not all of them are right for you. Take your time to research your options before choosing a new credit card.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.A couple of months ago, I wrote a story on the 10 best credit cards to get for college students. The article focused on cards that offer cash back, zero interest for a long time, and a large line of credit. While the piece received a good response, I know that most readers aren't college students or recent graduates.So I decided to take a different tack with today's article. I've decided to focus solely on the best credit cards for those who want to get the most bang for their buck. For example, I know that many of you value convenience above all else, and this article will explain the cards that give you that convenience and more. Others of you value cash back and rewards programs, and you'll learn about the best cards for that as well.All of the credit cards listed below have earned their spots by offering the best combination of convenience, flexibility, and rewards for consumers. If you're ready to put the time and effort into finding the best rewards card for your needs, then read on.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card is widely considered the best credit card on the market. Why? Because of its low interest rates, large welcome bonus, and numerous rewards programs.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card offers users a low interest rate of 14.24% (variable APR). For this reason alone, the card could be useful for consumers who are trying to pay off a big credit card balance but don't want to make a payment every month.The card's welcome bonus, which is 2x the number of points earned in the first three months of account opening, also contributes to its value. If you open the account with a $1,000 initial balance, then you'll have $2,000 worth of points after the first three months. These points can then be used for airfare, hotels, rental cars, and more.Finally, the card offers you three points for every dollar spent on travel and dining. It also gives you two points for every dollar spent on select entertainment and grocery purchases. To top it off, you'll earn one point for every dollar spent on other purchases.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card is the best credit card on the market because it gives you the largest return on your dollar.The Chase Freedom card is Chase's most widely available credit card. The main perk of the card is its high cash back rate. Chase gives you 5% cash back on purchases in specific categories for the first six months. These include:3% cash back on dining3% cash back on travel3% cash back on drugstore purchases3% cash back on popular streaming services3% cash back on fitness memberships and gyms3% cash back on home improvement stores3% cash back on popular online shopping sitesIf you spend just $2,000 in these categories for the first six months, then you'll get back $100 in cash. After those six months, you'll get 1% cash back in all of those categories. That's just 1.67% cash back, which is fairly standard. But if you add up the rates, then you'll get 18.67% cash back.The Chase Freedom card is the best cash back card on the market because it gives you the highest rate in select categories. If you want the best cash back possible, then this is the card to get.3. The Wells Fargo Cash Wise CardThe Wells Fargo Cash Wise Card is one of the best cash back cards on the market. The card offers a high 3% cash back rate on common purchases such as gas, groceries, and restaurants. It also gives you 1% cash back on all other purchases.The card's $100 sign-up bonus is a nice touch, too. And with the 0% introductory APR, you can save some money by not paying any interest charges on your purchases.Finally, there are no annual fees associated with the card. So it's a good deal in general, even if it doesn't offer the highest cash back rate.If you're looking for the best cash back card, then the Wells Fargo Cash Wise Card is the one for you.The American Express\u00ae Gold Card is a high-end credit card that offers a variety of perks to users. For starters, the card has a low annual fee of $250. It also offers a sign-up bonus of 50,000 Membership Rewards points, which are worth about $625 in cash or gift cards.But the real value of the American Express Gold Card comes from its ability to give you great cash back. For example, if you spend $2,000 on purchases each month, then you'll earn $250 in cash back. That's an effective annual rate of 5%.And if you make $5,000 worth of purchases in a month, then you'll earn $750 in cash back. That's an effective annual rate of 15%.Of course, there are some caveats to these rates. For example, you'll only earn 2x the amount of cash back on purchases made at restaurants, U.S. supermarkets, and certain other stores. And there's a $100 annual fee for the card.But overall, the American Express Gold Card is one of the best cash back cards on the market. If you're looking for the highest return on your dollar, then this is the one to get.5. The Citi Double Cash CardThe Citi Double Cash Card is one of the best cash back cards on the market. The card offers a 2% cash back rate on all purchases, which is higher than most other cards. And it's easy to use, because you just swipe the card like you would a regular credit card.Another thing to like about the Citi Double Cash Card is its low interest rate. If you have a good credit score, then you can get a low interest rate on the card.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I've heard good things about Amex, but I think Chase's points are more useful. I'm just trying to gauge how the community feels about credit cards.I use CapitalOne Venture card and the Reward are pretty good, plus I don't have to pay any annual fees. The rate is lower than a lot of other cards too.You might want to consider checking with some of your local banks too. They may not be able to offer the bonuses or other perks that the bigger banks have, but it will be free of charge and will come in handy for emergency situations.Sky_e22I don't really care for credit cards but I have one because some stores and restaurants accept it and it's convenient. I prefer using my debit card because it's just too easy to rack up a huge amount of credit card debt.I currently use an Amex card but I'm looking to switch to a Chase card due to the better rewards program.I've had both Amex and Chase and the Chase is hands down better. Amex is pretty good if you want to build your credit up and Chase offers decent rewards if you use it responsibly. Chase is my personal recommendation.Most of the credit card companies do not allow cash back. Some do, but it's very hard to come by and they also take a large cut of the amount. You can always call the credit card company and ask, however, and see what they can do for you.I think that the Chase Sapphire is the best rewards card right now, especially if you travel. The rewards are really solid and the card allows you to travel pretty much anywhere in the world. It also helps to get some good perks as well as the ability to redeem for cash if you need to.I'm not really that interested in credit cards. It seems like you have to do a lot of research into each one and then there's no guarantee that it'll be right for you. I don't even have a credit card.I think it would be wise for everyone to look around for what card would fit their needs and budget. There are a lot of things to consider when choosing a credit card. I am currently with Amex and I love it. It's not the biggest company but they do have really good perks and rewards.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. Are you looking to maximize your rewards or pay off your balance before you're charged interest?Personally, I'm not a big rewards guy. I like the idea of a low-interest card that doesn't charge foreign transaction fees, a low APR on my balance, and a good customer service. That's why I've used the Citi Diamond Preferred card for years. In case you're unfamiliar with the card, it has a 21-month promotional period and charges a 12.99% fixed APR. You must apply directly on the Citi site (see the link below) for the 21-month promotional period. It's also a pretty good option for anyone who's working on improving their credit score, since it only requires a credit score of 640+ to qualify. That being said, your application for the card will be denied if your credit score is lower than 640.The Citi Diamond Preferred Card charges an annual fee of $0 and does not allow you to transfer your balance from other credit card companies. That said, the card does allow you to transfer your balance from a Citi credit card. There is a 5% balance transfer fee (if you need a balance transfer, you will need to transfer to a card that doesn't charge a fee), but the card offers a low fixed interest rate (11.99% - 21.99%) and you can get a 21-month promotional period if you're approved. Citi also provides excellent customer service if you have any questions or need assistance with your balance. The company is a member of the Better Business Bureau and has an A+ rating. Additionally, the Citi Diamond Preferred card doesn't charge a foreign transaction fee, which can be useful if you're traveling abroad and need to make a purchase in a foreign currency. The company also offers an optional roadside assistance benefit. If you enroll, you can get help with lockout assistance, towing, emergency gasoline delivery, and other roadside assistance services. If you choose to apply for the Citi Diamond Preferred Card, you can do so here.While the Citi Diamond Preferred card is an excellent option, if you're looking for a credit card with rewards and perks, the Capital One Venture Rewards credit card might be more your style. The card offers unlimited 2 miles for every $1 spent on all purchases.

I find that even with a lower rewards rate, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card offers some great travel benefits that make it worth my while.The annual $95 membership fee is worth $600 worth of free travel from my favorite hotel program (Hilton HHonors). I also receive the first 4 nights free at any of Hilton's participating resorts around the world and earn 10X HHonors points (worth 30% back) on my other Hilton HHonors purchases.The $95 fee seems steep at first, but it's definitely worth it considering the free flights, free nights, and extra reward rate on my dining and travel expenses.It's hard to find a better credit card than the Chase Sapphire Reserve for the value it provides to frequent flyers. Even if you choose to avoid the $450 annual fee, you'll still find that the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card offers excellent perks.The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card's $95 annual fee might seem like a lot to pay, but that's only if you use it the wrong way. Since you earn 2x points on all travel and dining purchases, you have plenty of opportunities to offset the cost of the annual fee and make it work for you.I love having access to free flights with my favorite airline programs. It can be hard to find good deals on airfare, but I like to spend a little extra time planning ahead to find the best deals. When I'm on the fence about booking a flight, I like to use the rewards from my favorite credit card and purchase a flight with them instead. I then pay it off later and use the free flight to get to my destination.The free flights are a good way to make sure I never pay full price for my travels.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.A little while ago, I wrote about credit cards for freelancers. There, I suggested three cards that provide strong protection for freelancers. I'm curious to know if the freelancers out there would choose any of those three cards or go for something else entirely. And I'm curious to hear from those of you with more traditional full-time jobs too. What card works best for you?Here are a few reasons why I think the Capital One Spark Cash card (from Capital One) is one of the best credit cards available right now:It offers a 2% cash back rate on purchases in a wide variety of categories and earns a flat 1% cash back rate on all other purchases.There's no annual fee.The Spark Cash card is flexible: You can choose to redeem your cash back as a statement credit to reduce your balance, as a check in the mail, or as a direct deposit to your bank account.With no foreign transaction fees, it's a great card to have if you travel abroad or buy from international companies.The card features an introductory rate on new purchases of 0% APR for 15 months.The card also features an introductory rate on balance transfers of 0% APR for 15 months.It's a very good card if you're building your credit or have average to above average credit. (Read more about the card's credit requirements here.)If you have good credit, the Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card (from Capital One) is also worth a look. Like the Capital One Spark Cash card, it's a flexible card that lets you redeem your cash back as a statement credit or as a check in the mail. It also provides an introductory rate on balance transfers of 0% APR for 15 months.But the Venture Rewards Card's annual fee is $59. I don't think that fee is excessive, and you could redeem your cash back for travel through Capital One's travel site and earn double miles for flights purchased through the site. But, I do think the Spark Cash card provides the better value for your money if you don't travel a lot.Finally, if you'd like to have a card that lets you earn points for every purchase you make rather than cash back, I like the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. It's available to those with average to good credit and earns two points for every dollar you spend in a wide variety of categories. Those points are redeemable for gift cards or travel. Like the Capital One Spark Cash card, the Chase Sapphire Preferred card has an introductory interest rate of 0% APR for 15 months on new purchases.I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.While there is no single card that is best for everyone, there are a number of factors that should influence your decision. So I'll start by asking, \"Do you have good or bad credit?\"If you've got good credit, it's time to choose a card with a low interest rate and a big sign-up bonus, such as the Chase Freedom, BankAmericard, or USAA Cash Rewards card.You can also choose a card with low interest, such as the USAA or BankAmericard, and still get a generous sign-up bonus.If you're a bad credit risk, you'll want to choose a credit card with no annual fee and a high APR. The USAA Secured Card and Discover It Secured are two of the few such cards still available.These are just a few of the options you have available. Check out my credit card guide to learn more and to see cards that are right for you.Here's the story of how I chose my card, and what I'd do differently now.In college, I used a Citi card and a Discover it for all of my purchases. The Discover card offered no annual fee and I liked its 10% cashback on gas and groceries. The Discover card also came with no interest, which was important to me as a student.Over time, the Discover card started charging interest. The card also had a high penalty APR, meaning I'd have to pay 29.99% interest on any balance. I paid off this balance and then used the card occasionally.I continued with this pattern for several years. My FICO score was around 660. I'd apply for a credit card with a low interest rate and then stop using it. It took me a few years to graduate to my next card.I got my first credit card with a sign-up bonus. I was in my mid 20s and used it to build my credit. The card had an annual fee of $75, which I didn't mind paying since it had a 0% introductory interest rate.After about a year, the interest rate increased to 16.99%, and then again to 17.99%. At this point I began using it more frequently.My FICO score was around 670 and I got pre-approved for a BankAmericard with a 19.99% interest rate. This was a no-fee card with no sign-up bonus.About a year later, I was pre-approved for a Chase Freedom with a 21.99% interest rate and a $150 sign-up bonus.At the time I was thinking that the interest rate on the BankAmericard was low enough, so I switched.I used the Chase Freedom for the next few years.Over the course of my career, I've had a total of 15 credit cards. But the one that I've had the longest and have made my largest payments on is the BankAmericard.My FICO score is 714 now and I haven't applied for any new cards in years. I have been getting offers in the mail for cards with no annual fee and low interest rates. But for now I plan to stick with the same card.Do you have good or bad credit?If you've got good credit, it's time to choose a card with a low interest rate and a big sign-up bonus. There are many options, but here are some cards to consider.If you're a bad credit risk, you'll want to choose a credit card with no annual fee and a high APR. There are a few such cards still available, such as the USAA Secured Card and Discover It Secured.Whether you have good or bad credit, it's important to make a credit card choice that best meets your needs.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.My experience with credit cards has been an odd one. I've never really had a good relationship with them. In college, I always had one that I swore was going to be the one I could actually afford, so I would spend as much as I wanted on it. But, inevitably, I'd get a few hundred dollars in credit card bills and wouldn't be able to afford the interest rate on it.For the most part, I've tried to stay away from credit cards ever since. I've found other ways to get what I need without having to worry about how much I owe.However, as an adult, I've been considering getting a credit card again. It seems like the best option for me at the moment, as I don't have any credit cards right now and my spending habits are pretty decent. But which one should I get? I want something that has decent perks and low interest rates, but not so low that I can't afford the interest payments on it. I also don't want to be locked into a contract or anything like that.So what do you think? What credit card do you think is the best option for me?I have a credit card and I've been paying off the balance each month for years now. I've never had any problems with it. But I've been thinking about getting a different card with better benefits and lower interest rates, and I want to know what other people think.I'm wondering what you guys think about the current state of the credit card market. I think we've seen some interesting changes over the last couple of years, especially in the last few months. What do you think is going to happen next?If you've got a credit card, you've got something to worry about. In the past, credit cards were a way for people to borrow money, but now they're just a way to make purchases. And the way that people use them is changing. Credit cards are now more of a payment method than a borrowing tool.What does this mean for you? Well, if you're like most people, you probably have a credit card. If you don't, you should get one. But you need to be careful. Credit cards are becoming more expensive, and they're becoming more risky. That's why it's important to keep an eye on your credit score.This is where a good credit card monitoring service can come in handy. These services will keep an eye on your credit history and send you alerts if anything changes. They can also help you fix any problems with your credit card history, such as late payments or charges for items that you don't need.If you're interested in getting a credit card, there are a few things you should know. First, make sure you have a good credit score. Second, be careful about how you use your card. Last, use a good credit card monitoring service to keep an eye on your credit score and credit history.Best Restaurant Point Of Sale Software 2016</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.In my opinion, the Chase Sapphire Reserve is the gold standard among travel rewards credit cards. It has an incredible array of perks (including airport lounge access), a generous sign-up bonus, and it can be used for almost any purchase (it's accepted nearly everywhere that Mastercard is).But it does come with an annual fee of $450 -- and if you're not using the card to your advantage, it can quickly outstrip the value of its perks. So I'm curious to know what your credit card of choice is and what the card is doing for you.Is this a travel rewards card? Does it offer airport lounge access?How many points/miles/cashback did you earn from your latest purchase?How much value do you get out of your perks?Is it worth the annual fee?What's your favorite perk, and why?I'd love to hear about your credit card!</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.Honestly, I think the best perks, low interest rates, and overall flexibility are all going to come from a cash back card. That being said, I'd take an unlimited rewards card if it allowed for the same features as the cash back card, especially since it seems like the average consumer is not utilizing their rewards properly.I think that the rewards cards provide an opportunity to earn some free money or some free merchandise if you're diligent about using the card for daily expenses. I know a few people who are getting into some really big credit card debt, but if you pay the card off every month (or as soon as possible), you'll never actually have to pay interest or fees on it.I would agree that cashback cards are usually the best option, and the one's with the best cash back rewards programs are almost always the best option. Some cash back cards even have no annual fees and no foreign transaction fees. It's just a great way to save money.That being said, the cashback cards with low rewards are usually not that great of an option. If you're going to be putting a significant amount of money on your credit card every month, then you might as well try to earn more rewards from that.I think that it's best to get a cashback card with rewards. The more money you spend, the more you will earn. The other option is that of a cashback card without rewards. In that scenario, you won't earn money, but you will get some extra cash back on certain purchases.If you don't mind having to pay a fee for every purchase you make, then getting a rewards card is probably the best option for you.In my opinion, rewards cards are the best option. You will get a certain percentage back on certain purchases, like groceries and gas. You will also earn points for using the card, and then you can redeem those points for gift cards or airline miles.I think rewards cards are better for people who are already into traveling a lot and who spend a lot of money on things like gas and groceries. Cash back cards are great for people who want to get money back for everything they purchase, but there's a limited amount of money you can get back each month.In my opinion, I think the best option is the one that will work best for your lifestyle. I know I can't get away with not using my credit card because I spend a lot of money on traveling, so I have to have a rewards card.I don't know what to think about the rewards cards that give you cash back on everything, but I like that they give you a little more flexibility in terms of how you can spend your money.In my opinion, the best card is the one that's going to give you the best value for your money. I think that the rewards cards that give you cash back on everything are probably the best option, because it's nice to be able to get cash back on all of your purchases.There are a lot of different credit cards out there, so it can be hard to know which one is best for you.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.That being said, this doesn't have to be a one-size-fits-all question. I'd love to know what people like you use (and like) about each card. What makes you choose the card you choose? Are there any specific perks (i.e. sign-up bonus, cash-back, etc.) that make you choose this one card over others?Here's the official rules for this thread:1) One entry per day per person.

If you need to reply to a post that is already part of this thread, that's what the reply button is for.I'll be the first.I use the Barclaycard Arrival Plus World MasterCard, mainly for its 2% cash-back. I use it for everything, and even to pay my rent. That cash-back is a no-brainer. There's nothing better than getting cash back for every dollar I spend. It's a no-fee card with great reviews, and it allows me to earn cash back in the form of miles to transfer to Delta, which I love.I also have the Capital One Venture Card, which I use on my car, house, and other stuff that's not groceries. I use the card I got from my bank for gas.So really, my answer is \"the Arrival Plus and my other cards.\" But you asked for one card, so I said Arrival Plus. I can explain why I have so many cards in another post.My \"one card\" is the Citi Prestige card. I love the 4th night free when I book a 4-night or longer hotel stay with a Citi Prestige card (this benefit was just introduced earlier this year). And I get 5x points per dollar spent at the airport/airline lounges and on airline tickets. I have the 50k sign up bonus and got my first 25k rewards last month. This is the card that I'm planning on redeeming for an American Airlines flight next month (after transferring points to a British Airways card so that I can fly British Airways to Europe for 5k points per person).I also have the Discover IT (which I don't love because the 5% cash back isn't that great and the 1.5% cash back on everything else doesn't impress me much). But I like Discover's \"freeze your credit report\" function.As far as travel rewards cards, I have the Citi ThankYou Premier and Chase Sapphire Preferred cards, as well as the Barclaycard Arrival Plus and a no-fee Southwest card. But the Arrival Plus is the one card I use for everything.So many great answers in here!I'll play this game, too. My one card is the Chase Sapphire Preferred. I love that it has no foreign transaction fees and that it has a reasonable annual fee and a 20K point bonus. Plus the 2X points on travel and 1X points on everything else are hard to beat.The Discover IT card sounds like a great option, too. 5% on dining is really good. The Southwest card and no-fee Southwest card are also fantastic. My dad is going to be using the no-fee one for his next international trip, which will give me some bonus points.It's also interesting that several people use their bank cards for everything. My parents have the same approach. They get cash back from all their purchases through their bank, which is great!My current one card that I have now is the Citi Thank You Premier. Before that, I had the Citi Thank You Preferred. It's still a good card, especially for new cardholders. I got 10,000 bonus points when I signed up for the card and I used those points for a free two night stay at a Hyatt. I really like the Thank You Premier as a travel rewards card for two reasons:1. The 2X rewards on travel. This is one of the best aspects of the card.2. The 1.6X rewards on restaurants. I like the 1.6X rewards since my wife and I like to eat out.I had the Citi Thank You Preferred before and I loved that card. It was good for earning rewards, but I also liked that card because I got 5,000 bonus Thank You points when I made my first purchase on the card.One card that I would recommend is the Chase Sapphire Preferred. The only downside is that you don't get a sign-up bonus like the Citi cards, but it's still a great card.The Chase Sapphire Preferred has no foreign transaction fees and it's 2X rewards for travel. Plus, the rewards that you earn from this card can be redeemed for travel or for cash.I use a Chase Sapphire Preferred card, but it's not my \"only\" card. It's just one of the many cards that I have.I think the best travel rewards card is the Citi Thank You Premier or the Citi Thank You Preferred. The best rewards card that I have is the Capital One Venture.Chase Sapphire Preferred and United Mileage Plus Explorer are my current cards. I use the Sapphire Preferred for all of my everyday spending and travel. I've had it for about two months and I really like it. It has no annual fee and you get 50,000 Ultimate Rewards points for signing up. I used mine for a free night at a Sheraton in downtown Chicago. The United Explorer card is similar, but you have to spend at least $2,000 in the first three months. I plan on using it for traveling next year.I would also recommend the Capital One Venture card. I love that you can earn 2X miles for all your purchases and then transfer those miles to United Airlines and other partners. I have no other travel rewards card because I don't want to earn points on travel and I don't want to use a card just for travel. I'm happy using Venture for all of my non-travel purchases.I'll play this game, too. I have a Citi ThankYou Premier. I have a sign-up bonus of 20K points, but my main reason for getting the card was its no annual fee. I also like that I get 2X points on travel. I plan on using the card to pay for a cruise I'm taking in the fall. The 2X points on travel are great!I have the Barclaycard Arrival Plus World MasterCard. It's not my \"one card,\" but it's still a good card and I like it. I get 2% cash back on all my purchases, plus I'm looking forward to a new sign-up bonus of 50K miles. The only reason that I didn't give this card my \"one card\" designation is that I only like it because of the 2% cash back and not the rewards, which aren't the best.My answer is the Citi Thank You Premier. It has no annual fee and it has the 2X rewards for travel. I've been getting 20K bonus points for opening up a new credit card, which is great. Plus, I have enough Thank You points for a round-trip flight anywhere.I also have the Capital One Venture card, which is good for 2X rewards for all my purchases. I also have the Discover It card, which is good for 5% cash back on dining. I've been getting 5% cash back on dining for the last 6 months and I'm glad that I opened that account because I'm about to have a free night stay at a Hilton hotel that I used some of the rewards I earned from the Discover It card.I also have the Capital One Quicksilver cash rewards card. I use this card to pay for my gas, my groceries, and other things.I also have the Barclaycard Arrival Plus World MasterCard. I like that card because I get 2% cash back on all my purchases, but I don't love the card for the rewards.I think the Citi Thank You Premier is a really good card, too. I've had the card for about two months and I like that it has no annual fee and that it has 2X rewards for travel. I'm going to use it for a round-trip flight next year.So my \"one card\" is the Citi Thank You Premier, but I also like the Citi Thank You Preferred, Discover It, Barclaycard Arrival Plus World MasterCard, and Capital One Venture cards.My answer is the Capital One Venture card, but I also have a Citi Thank You Premier. I'm waiting to use the bonus points that I got from my Citi Thank You Premier card, but I do like the Capital One Venture card.I love that the Capital One Venture card has no annual fee and that I get 2X miles for all my purchases. The only thing that I don't like about the card is that I don't know exactly what to do with all of the miles that I earn. I do like that I can transfer my miles to other partners, though.So I'll play the \"one card\" game. I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred, but I don't have a card as my only credit card. I have several different cards, but I use the Chase Sapphire Preferred card to pay for things like gas, groceries, clothing, and other things. I don't use it for travel because it doesn't have any travel rewards. I also don't use it for dining because it has a 2.5X rewards for travel, but a 1X rewards for dining.I also have the Barclaycard Arrival Plus World MasterCard, which I use for my everyday purchases and for travel. I have about 50,000 miles with the Barclaycard Arrival Plus card, but I use it as my only credit card. I like that card because it has 2X rewards for travel and because it doesn't have any foreign transaction fees. I also like that it has a no-annual-fee option.I also have the Chase Freedom Unlimited card, which I'm not using as my only credit card. I like the card because it has no annual fee and it has a 1.5% rewards rate. I'm using it for travel because I can use my points for travel. I also like the fact that I can transfer my rewards points to airline partners.I also have the Chase Freedom card, which I'm using for dining and other purchases. I don't like that card as much because I don't like the 1X rewards rate for dining. I would prefer 2X rewards for dining.My answer is the Capital One Venture card. I like it because I get 2X miles for all my purchases and because I don't know exactly what to do with all of the miles that I earn. The only thing that I don't like about the card is that I don't know what to do with all of the miles that I earn. I don't like that I have to transfer my miles to another partner, but I like that I can transfer my miles to other partners.So I'll play the \"one card\" game.

The only thing that I don't like about the card is that I have to transfer my miles to other partners, but I like that I can transfer my miles to airline partners.I would also say that I'm happy to have the Barclaycard Arrival Plus World MasterCard.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. What are your top choices?Personally I've always held a Gold Delta AmEx card. I'm not in the best financial standing, but it allows me to have free upgrades to Delta flights as long as I pay my bill on time, as well as free checked bags. The 20% off restaurants, car rentals, hotels is a big plus as well.I don't think I could have said it better. I'm 26 and just got my first credit card about 3 months ago. I used to think credit cards were bad, and even went so far as to avoid it because of the credit score thing, etc. It's all a bunch of fear mongering. If you don't like the way the cards work, don't get them. It's that simple. There's tons of great options out there, and no need to be in debt. I have a couple different credit cards, and use each card for different things. I've never been sucked into \"debt\" and I'm always paying off my cards when they come due, so it's not like I'm paying off interest. It's like using any other debit/credit card. Some places will charge you a % of the purchase on your CC, while others don't care. You just have to know which places don't care.If you don't want a credit card, just don't get one. I see a bunch of people who think a credit card is bad and they are. They are if you use them wrong. You don't have to have a credit card to get the rewards, points, etc. My mom used to go to the travel agents and get \"travel points\". So it's all about what you want and how you use it. It's not like we are going to get sucked into debt because we used a credit card for a few days in our life.Anyone who uses a credit card should know it's not the end of the world. The best cards are the ones that have 0% interest. That is how it's supposed to work. No interest for a year if you pay off your bill in full. I've been using cards since I was 19, and never had any problems. If you use them right you won't have any problems either. You need to know how to use them right.I have an AmEx Blue Cash Card which gives me 3% on groceries, and 2% on gas and department store purchases. I've held it for about 3 years, and it's paid itself off.I just recently upgraded to the AmEx Platinum Card.Both are from American Express.I would definitely go with a travel card. That is what I did and I am very happy with the choices and rewards.American Express seems to be very good if you travel for business or pleasure.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.What's your credit card? What do you like and dislike about it?I've been using the Capital One credit card, which offers 1.25% cash back for every dollar I spend. I also pay an annual fee of $0 (it's free). I can access my cash reward through Capital One or have it sent directly to my bank account (which I prefer).With the low interest rates and no annual fee, the Capital One credit card has been a solid investment for me.I'm on my second credit card after I made a mistake with the first one. My first credit card (American Express) was my worst mistake. I used that card for about 5 months and the interest got me. I had to pay a lot of interest, so I canceled the card. I'm still on the same credit union but with different credit card (Visa).I have had a few cards over the years, but recently I moved to the Discover credit card which gives you 5% cash back on all purchases, and that is unlimited. You can get 1% back too which is based on how much you spend each month, plus a 0% annual interest rate. I believe they have been around for 15 years.I use a Discover card as well. It gives you 5% cash back on rotating categories (like grocery store and gas) and 1% back on everything else. I get paid for every dollar I spend, so I love that.I don't know what my card is called or what it does. I got it as a birthday present from my dad. He said that he wanted me to get a credit card and be responsible with it. I have my own business and I have a big amount of credit that I can use.That's great to hear, and it's so important to be responsible with your credit card and credit limit.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.A good credit card is one that provides you with cash back, rewards points, or other perks without hiking your interest rate or imposing other penalties on you.Because of these benefits, credit cards allow people to pay for everything from purchases of groceries and clothing to plane tickets and hotel rooms with an incomparable ease and convenience. In fact, many people would argue that they're the very best payment method to use for a wide variety of goods and services.What is the best credit card?The best credit card for you will depend on your needs and goals. If you're a frequent traveler, for example, then a card that provides you with miles or points could be ideal for you. If you're more focused on getting cash back on your purchases, then it makes more sense to get a card that offers you cash back for every dollar you spend.But perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is that when you apply for a new credit card, you should consider your credit score and your credit history before deciding to do so.It's especially important to pay off your credit card balances in full each month, so you don't pay more in interest fees than you can afford. A credit card that offers 0% interest on balance transfers can also be a great option for someone who wants to consolidate their debt and get out of it.If you have a strong credit history, then applying for a new credit card can be a great way to take advantage of all the perks that come with it, such as cash back or miles on your purchases. The key, as mentioned before, is to do your research and select a card that offers the benefits that you want at a rate and annual fee that you can afford.</s>",

The right small business credit card can be a valuable financial tool to manage and grow your business.How to Choose a Small Business Credit CardA small business credit card can be an efficient way to manage cash flow and expenses, but the process of choosing the best one can be a challenge. The following tips can help you select the best card for your small business needs:Find a card that earns rewards on business-related purchases and provides cash back or a low-interest rate on all purchases. Some small business credit cards earn higher rewards in specific categories, such as office supplies or travel, while others earn bonus rewards on all spending. Some cards provide a fixed introductory APR on balance transfers and new purchases, while others offer an ongoing low interest rate on balance transfers.You may be required to meet certain minimum credit score requirements in order to qualify for a card with an introductory APR, or the introductory APR may not be available if your credit score is below a certain level.Avoid cards that charge an annual fee or a foreign transaction fee. Many small business credit cards are free of both fees.Be wary of annual fees and high interest rates. Although many small business credit cards are free to use, others may charge annual fees. Some business credit cards also charge higher interest rates than regular credit cards, especially for those with poor credit.Consider whether you need to redeem your rewards for cash back or gift cards, and compare the rewards rates of different cards.Business Credit Cards with Low Interest RatesBusiness Credit Cards with No Annual FeeBusiness Credit Cards with No Foreign Transaction FeesIn recent years, the rise of online shopping has increased demand for businesses to offer online payment options. For this reason, many small business credit cards offer extra benefits and perks when shopping online, such as price protection, travel accident insurance, extended warranty protection and purchase protection. If you use your credit card to pay for an item online, you may be able to get help if the item is damaged or defective.For example, the Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business offers up to $10,000 in protection for eligible items purchased within the first 60 days of card ownership. If you use your card for online purchases, this protection can help you recover your money if something goes wrong.Another perk of online shopping is the ability to earn rewards on your purchases. While not all business credit cards offer this, many will give you a bonus on your first purchase.For example, the Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business offers a 50,000 mile bonus on your first purchase of $4,500 or more within the first three months. With Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business, you can also get a one-time $200 statement credit after spending $2,000 within the first three months of card ownership.Business credit cards are generally more expensive than personal credit cards because they're designed for business use. Business credit cards tend to have higher annual fees than personal credit cards, and they can have stricter requirements for approval.If you have poor credit, it can be difficult to qualify for a small business credit card. You may need a co-signer or an excellent credit score in order to qualify. You should also keep in mind that your personal credit history will be used in determining your eligibility for a business credit card.Business Credit Cards for Business Owners with Poor CreditWhat's the best business credit card?The best business credit card is the one that fits your spending needs and rewards strategy.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.Personally, I'm in a great situation right now. I've gotten a low interest credit card that I've only used to make purchases on. I pay it off every single month. So, it's a bit of a no-brainer. I have no interest in the perks. I have no interest in getting the lowest interest rate. I've got a 36 month car loan that I'm currently paying off with a balance transfer.I have a second credit card which I've had for almost 5 years and which I still have no balance on. I haven't even been using it to buy things, but it does give me about $250 in rewards to spend each year at Christmas and on other special occasions.So, I'm curious if any of you have any other advice or opinions?My recommendation: Use your lowest interest credit card for the purchases you need to make that you know you will pay off in 1-2 months. You'll pay interest on the balance, but it will be the least amount you'll pay.Then, have another card you use if you need to charge something and the lowest interest card isn't an option for some reason.Your credit is good enough to qualify for a lot of credit cards. You can use this as a way to start shopping around. See which cards give you the most rewards or perks for the money you spend on the cards. You don't have to sign up for every card, though. Just sign up for a few cards, test them out, and see which ones work for you.I would just like to say, I'm surprised there was no one who recommended not carrying a balance. Even the lowest rate credit card carries fees, interest, and other charges that can outweigh any benefits that the card offers. Paying it off in full each month and you get free money for your purchases. No interest rates, no fees, no payments.I don't carry a balance. I never have and never will.I have 3 credit cards. 2 are for purchases, 1 is to earn rewards. The 2 cards I use to make purchases are low rate/low fee/low payments.My 3rd card is for rewards. I charge my phone bill to that card, plus any gas I buy, and other little things. That way, I can earn rewards. The rewards I've earned have been better than my reward accounts at the bank. It has been worthwhile.I don't know about the OP, but I would guess that he/she is trying to keep good credit. The only way to do that is to not let your balances get out of hand. If you only use your cards once or twice a year, then your credit is not affected. Also, I believe that by keeping your credit usage low, you will be eligible for better interest rates on loans. That is a biggy to me.I use a credit card to pay my rent once a month. I pay it off in full, so I get free rent.I use it to pay my bills. I pay it off in full.I use it to buy things. When I buy things, I pay it off in full.So I have no balances, so I have no interest, and no fees.I don't have to carry cash around to buy things. I can buy things anywhere in the world, and pay for them when I get home.I have a rewards credit card.Whenever I am paying with cash, I can get back rewards. I can also save money by not buying things from places that do not accept credit cards.I have a few credit cards. I pay them off monthly, so I have no debt.The only time I use one is to buy something at a store that I want to get points on or to get cash back.There's no downside to using credit cards, just like there's no downside to driving a car. The difference between the two is, if you drive a car and you run out of money, you could die, but if you use a credit card and you run out of money, you'll just get a phone call asking for it back.I have 2 cards. I use one for groceries, the other for gas.You can't go wrong with either, they are both excellent credit cards.I get the perks and points on the first and the low interest on the second.I don't think there's any right or wrong with credit cards. I've heard people say it's bad to use one if you can't pay it off in full each month, but I don't think that's necessarily true. It can be a good thing for you if you don't use credit cards at all. It sounds like the OP is doing a good job.Credit cards are a necessary evil. Without them, it is virtually impossible to rent a car or to buy an airplane ticket. So you need one to do those things, and you are stuck with paying interest and a high annual fee for the \"privilege\" of doing so.I do not use a credit card to make purchases. I use a debit card for that.Credit cards are just one more reason why the US is drowning in debt.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.My current situation is as follows:- I pay 0.9% interest- I'm on the cash-back plan- My credit is super strongI'd like to get a new card that I can use to re-build credit for my sister-in-law. However, the last thing I need is to be paying a lot of interest. Any thoughts?I have a similar situation except that I'm on the reward plan. I am looking for a new card as well.I'd like to hear other ideas.We have the Amex Platinum with 100K bonus points but no rewards points, just airline miles. I don't like the idea of being in debt with the airline companies since they all go out of business. I have heard that Chase has great rewards cards. Does anyone know which card to go for?Thanks in advance for all your input.Chase Freedom card. Earn 5% cash back in rotating categories. There is a 3 month wait before you can get another card so the sign up bonus is $100.I have one. It's the \"blue\" one that says \"Chase Freedom\" on the front.How long have you been waiting? I haven't been able to get one since 2005, but that's because I just haven't been in a good financial position to qualify. If you're able to get it, I'd say it's a really nice card to have.I had the Platinum Chase card and had great service from them.The best card is the US Air Card that you get with Air MilesI've been waiting to get another AmEx card for a few months.I know that there is a 3-month waiting period before you can get another AmEx card. However, what I'm curious about is whether the 3 months starts from the day that you cancelled your last card or the day you applied for the new card.I cancelled my last card about 2 months ago and have been thinking of applying for a new card. I'd love to get a new AmEx card but am worried about being blacklisted by AmEx if I apply for a new card too soon.I'm not an AmEx user, but I think the blacklisting you fear is called the 2/4/6 rule. I'm not sure what the penalty is if you go over 4 cards per 12 months, but that's where it starts.My husband has the AmEx Blue and has for many years. I haven't looked into all the details, but I do know that they have a higher approval rate for women than men. I think it may also have to do with your age and other factors. He's 40 and they're always happy to give him a new card.In my own opinion, I would rather go with a credit union than with Chase. You can get really great rewards from credit unions and I've had much better luck with them then Chase.Anyways, I'd just look into different credit unions. Maybe your bank has a credit union affiliation.I had a Chase credit card for quite some time before switching to a Credit Union a few years back. I have a few different cards now and they all give cash back or rewards for gas purchases or airline miles (or both).The cash back is automatic every month and it comes in the form of a debit to my checking account. You can check the balance of your reward points online anytime. If you're on the cash back plan, then every 2 months you should get a statement on how much cash you have back in your account.I've never had to call customer service since I've had the card. They have online chat, but I haven't used it.I've gotten better interest rates and rewards from Credit Unions.I have a cash back card that gives 1% on everything. I get 3% on groceries, gas and drug stores, so that makes it 4%.But it was Chase and they had some type of promotion where they increased the cash back from 1.5% to 2% for 6 months.The thing I don't like about cash back cards is that the interest is low. But I guess it works for me because I pay the entire thing off every month.I would definitely avoid American Express if you want to have good credit because they will limit you to 3 cards per year (2 if you're under 30 I think). If you don't know what it's like to have a lot of credit, then you won't understand the impact this will have on your credit score.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.As many of you know, I'm quite enthusiastic about the benefits of the Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card. The card has been in my wallet for many years, and its $95 annual fee is well worth the annual travel rewards and perks.In this post, I'd like to compare the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card to two other credit cards that I consider as my top choices for an \"everyday\" credit card: the Bank of America Premium Rewards Card and the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card.Although I'll try to provide as much insight as possible, keep in mind that I'm in no way a financial advisor. I'm just an enthusiastic traveler who's always looking for the best way to get the most out of every travel dollar.Without further ado, let's take a closer look at these three credit cards.If you're not familiar with the Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card, let me tell you a little bit about it.The card offers two types of rewards points:- Chase Ultimate Rewards- Chase Sapphire Preferred Travel PointsThese points can then be redeemed for travel at 1.25 cents per point on airfare, 1 cent per point on hotels, and 0.8 cents per point on everything else. For example, if you redeem 20,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points for airfare, you'll receive a $250 airline travel statement credit.In addition to the travel rewards, you'll earn two points per dollar spent on travel and dining (2 points per $1 spent), one point per dollar spent on all other purchases (1 point per $1 spent), and earn $500 as a sign-up bonus once you spend $4,000 within three months of opening your account.As for the annual fee, you'll need to pay $95 each year.The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is another excellent card to consider. In addition to the $95 annual fee, you'll receive a $100 sign-up bonus once you spend $3,000 within three months of opening your account.The card's primary rewards program is called Capital One Miles, and you can redeem your miles in several ways. First, you can use the Capital One Miles program to book airfare and hotels at a rate of 0.7 cents per mile (1 cent per mile in Canada). Alternatively, you can transfer your miles to any of Capital One's more than 20 travel partners. For example, you can transfer your miles to Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer at a rate of 1.3 miles per dollar (2 miles per dollar in Canada).While I like to use the Capital One Miles program to book airfare and hotels, I typically transfer my miles to Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer to earn the maximum amount of miles. If I were to book a Singapore Airlines flight, for example, the cost of my flight could range from 50,000 miles to 110,000 miles. For example, I recently paid $4,043 for a round-trip business-class ticket to Japan, and I only needed 55,000 miles to complete the purchase.Capital One Venture Rewards Cardholders Can Earn Extra MilesAs a Capital One Venture Rewards Cardholder, you can earn extra miles on every purchase. For example, if you were to make $10,000 in purchases during the first year, you'd receive a 20,000-mile bonus, bringing your total rewards to 20,000 miles (the $10,000 in purchases includes the $3,000 sign-up bonus, so you'll actually be receiving 23,000 miles).As you can see, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card offers a lot of flexibility in terms of redeeming miles and transferring miles to different airlines. I like this flexibility because I enjoy using my miles to book flights and hotels when it's most convenient for me, not just when it's most convenient for Capital One.Alternatively, you can also cash in your miles with a statement credit. For example, if you have 20,000 Capital One Miles, you'll receive a $200 statement credit.I find this feature especially valuable because you don't have to worry about your rewards being devalued or limited in any way. I'd rather have the flexibility of choosing how I want to use my miles.Now that we've talked about some of the Capital One Venture Rewards Card's unique features, let's move on to the Bank of America Premium Rewards Card.The Bank of America Premium Rewards Card offers some pretty amazing perks for its $95 annual fee.The card offers two different rewards programs:- Bank of America Cash Rewards- Bank of America Travel Rewards- 3% cash back on gas purchases, 2% cash back at grocery stores, and 1% cash back on all other purchases (on the first $1,500 in purchases every quarter)- 25% boost to the value of Bank of America Travel Rewards (capped at 3.5% cash back)The Bank of America Premium Rewards Card also offers two bonus options:- $200 in cash rewards when you make at least $500 in purchases during the first 90 days of opening your account- $100 in cash rewards when you make at least $2,000 in purchases during the first 90 days of opening your accountThe card offers a 0% APR promotion, and it comes with the same security benefits as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card.Finally, the Bank of America Premium Rewards Card offers $100 in airline credits, and you'll receive an additional $100 credit if you use the card to pay for your airline tickets through Bank of America's preferred partners.The Bank of America Premium Rewards Card offers a ton of great perks for its annual fee, and I'm very impressed with how much value the card offers. However, I don't think the card is right for me.Why? Because I prefer the flexibility of the Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card's rewards program, and I don't like having to transfer miles to other airlines.However, this card is perfect for someone who is a Bank of America customer and likes to travel a lot.Bank of America is an excellent credit card for people who like to travel, and the $100 annual travel credit makes it even more attractive.Now that we've talked about the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, Capital One Venture Rewards Card, and Bank of America Premium Rewards Card, let's talk about my favorite credit card.I have many cards in my wallet, but none are more versatile than the Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card. I love the card's flexibility, and I especially like how I can earn unlimited travel rewards without worrying about devaluation.The Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card also offers $95 in annual credits, and I love how I can use those credits to offset the cost of my travel expenses. For example, I recently used the credit to cover the cost of my hotel room, which saved me a lot of money.Finally, the card offers a ton of travel benefits, including travel insurance, trip protection, and a 24-hour customer service number. The Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card is definitely my favorite travel card, and I don't see myself ever changing my mind.So, what's your favorite credit card? Is it the Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card? The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card? The Bank of America Premium Rewards Card? Let me know in the comments below!</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I'm also curious to know what you would tell a friend who was looking for a new credit card, and what you look for in a credit card.My card of choice: The American Express Gold Card.I signed up for the American Express Gold card after reading a lot of good things about it on websites like Huffington Post and Business Insider. I wanted to earn a ton of travel rewards, and the Amex Gold card provides a huge array of rewards to earn (5x the rewards in select categories), a 25,000 point sign-up bonus after spending $2,000, and an unlimited 1-year warranty extension.Since then, I've made the decision to keep the card and it has more than paid for itself with free Uber rides, airport lounge access, 5x points on airfare, and 5x points on hotels.I also feel like Amex Gold card has been good about providing benefits for its customers. A few years ago they had a promotion where the Amex Gold card customers could purchase a $200 Gilt gift card for $150. They also had a promotion where all cardholders could purchase a $50 Amex gift card for $40 (this promotion just happened).If you're looking for an Amex credit card, I would highly recommend the Amex Gold. You get a lot of travel rewards, some great rewards for dining and gas, and all the perks that come with being a cardholder. It's been one of the best investments I've made, and I've saved thousands of dollars since getting it.I'm on a few different credit cards.I have a Citi ThankYou Preferred Card because I love the airline rewards, and I love that it offers 20,000 ThankYou points as a sign-up bonus after I spend $1,500 in 3 months.I also have a Bank of America Platinum Plus Visa for my travel rewards, and I have a Capital One VentureOne Rewards card that I'll keep because I've had the card since college.If I were to recommend a credit card to someone else, I'd recommend the Citi ThankYou Preferred Card because it provides an airline rewards program with 20,000 points as a sign-up bonus and 2x points at restaurants, supermarkets, and drug stores.I'd tell my friends to apply for a credit card that offers airline miles because you get free travel. My friends who travel a lot tell me that they prefer to pay with airline miles over cash when they travel, and I can see why.A credit card helps me be more disciplined when it comes to my spending habits.I have an American Express Gold Card and a Capital One VentureOne Rewards.I choose the Capital One VentureOne Rewards for convenience, and because it offers 10,000 miles when you sign up and 10,000 miles after you spend $3,000 within the first 6 months.I chose the American Express Gold card because it offers a $100 Amex statement credit when you use your card to book a flight and spend $2,000 on travel within the first 6 months, and 4x the points on dining and 2x the points on travel.The Capital One VentureOne Rewards is good for traveling and it helps you save money on travel because you can use your points to cover the cost of a flight or hotel.I think everyone should have a credit card that has travel benefits because it's so much easier to earn points and redeem them than it is with cash.I have an American Express Gold Card and a Chase Sapphire Preferred card.I've heard a lot about the Amex Gold Card, so I signed up for one.

I also like that the card offers a sign-up bonus, which is 25,000 ThankYou points after you spend $1,500 in 3 months.I chose the Amex Everyday card because it offers 10,000 Membership Rewards points as a sign-up bonus after you spend $1,000 within 3 months, and 2x points at supermarkets, drugstores, gas stations, and restaurants.I'd tell my friends to apply for the Citi Premier card because it offers a free checked bag, and the Amex Everyday card because it offers 2x the points at supermarkets, drugstores, gas stations, and restaurants.I have a Chase Sapphire Preferred and a Capital One Venture Rewards card.I love that I can use the Chase Sapphire Preferred to get 2x the points on travel and dining, which is why I signed up for it.

I also don't fly enough to make the 5x for travel worthwhile.BNY isn't available for me, and I don't have a Discover card, so I can't speak to them.I don't use the free TSA credit, but I think it's awesome that it exists.Citibank/AAdvantage Platinum CardAmex Platinum or BofA Platinum Honors Rewards (if 5% back is worth anything)Discover More (if you actually use your Discover card)Find More Posts by bhk11Originally Posted by nlittleAs someone else who is on the fence between two of these, I'd also love to hear what folks think. My biggest concerns are 1) the 5X points at restaurants (vs. 5x at hotels which is what most of my spending goes to), and 2) if I can really use the $300 airfare credit (i.e. on things like taxes, etc...).For me, if I end up getting the Amex, I might be able to switch my Chase Marriott card (2x at Marriott) to this so I end up with 4x at Marriott (and the ability to do transfers to United).Find More Posts by the.beavI had a Chase Sapphire Preferred and used it for airfare and hotels. I had a $300 credit per year, which I had to be a little strategic about. It took me a while to use up the entire credit. I was able to use it on car rentals and taxes and fees, etc. For me, I'd say it was the best credit card I've ever had. But I'm not sure if that was because of the Chase Sapphire Preferred or the Chase Ultimate Rewards system in general.I'm not super into points and miles (not because I don't like to travel, but because I don't like having to worry about how much something costs) so I don't know how it works in the \"reward\" world.Originally Posted by bhk11This would be my choice as well. I know I'll be able to use the annual fee credit for at least two round trip flights.The Chase Ultimate Rewards is the most flexible program around. I'm not really familiar with Discover's system, but I know that if you transfer to a major alliance program, you will be able to use your points to book a flight (i.e. AA, BA, US, etc.).My biggest concerns are 1) the 5X points at restaurants (vs. 5x at hotels which is what most of my spending goes to), and 2) if I can really use the $300 airfare credit (i.e. on things like taxes, etc...).I'm assuming that you are getting the Citi / AAdvantage Platinum card, and not the Citi Prestige (with the travel credit). I think that 5x at restaurants is really valuable, so I would say that it is worth it, regardless of how much you actually eat out.The airfare credit doesn't really work for me. When I fly, I have to go through a couple of credit cards before I pay for anything, and I almost never pay for a flight outright. I always have to pay for taxes and fees with the airline website or by telephone. I had to use the credit once and got $30 off, which didn't even cover the taxes on my flight. I'm planning on canceling the card before the annual fee is due next summer, just so I don't have to figure out what to use the credit for.I have a different BofA card that I use for most purchases (the BofA Platinum Honors Rewards card, which has 5x points at groceries and 2x at restaurants). This is also a really good card. If I need to use an airline credit, I'll use the BofA Platinum Honors card, since I get so many more points. I find that I really enjoy earning points. I don't care much about how many points I get for a specific purchase, but I really enjoy knowing that I'm getting something in return for what I spend. It gives me more of a sense of control.I'm probably not the right person to ask, as I have never used this card. If you are interested in it, I would recommend searching for opinions on flyertalk, where there is a dedicated forum for this card.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.For me, the Citi Simplicity card comes pretty close.For a single annual fee of $95, I receive a $0% intro APR on balance transfers for the first 18 months I'm a cardholder. I can use that time to consolidate all my other credit card debt onto one easy-to-manage card.I'm also rewarded $200 every year I make a purchase on the card. I can use that money to pay off any of my outstanding debt, or spend it how I choose.My balance will never become too much for me to pay off, either. The Citi Simplicity card doesn't have a cap on my credit limit. Instead, I can continue borrowing money as long as I repay what I've already borrowed.In my experience, the Citi Simplicity card is a much better choice than the Capital One card. For one thing, I don't have to worry about Capital One changing my interest rate as often as Citi does.Citi changes my interest rate every six months based on my credit report, while Capital One will change my interest rate based on a 25-year rolling average.Citi will also increase my APR based on how I use the card. If I spend more than 30% of my available credit, my interest rate will go up. If I pay my bill before the due date, my interest rate will go down.Citi Simplicity doesn't work this way. If I'm in a position where I have to pay interest, I don't want it to be based on anything other than my actual finances.I've heard from other people who love the Capital One card and swear by it, but I don't want my credit card to depend on how I use it. I prefer to have control over my financial situation, rather than the other way around.I like that I can get a $0% intro APR on balance transfers with the Citi Simplicity card. I've heard this is a great benefit that will let me use my new card to consolidate other high-interest debt.I'm excited to use the Capital One card as a way to earn money back for every purchase I make. I haven't heard of anyone else doing this before, but I think it's a great idea.I want to be able to earn 1.25% back on every purchase I make. The Capital One card also lets me use the money to make a purchase at any of my favorite stores.I like the perks the Capital One card offers me as a member. I think they're an important factor to consider before signing up for a credit card.The Capital One card offers 20% more cash back than the Citi Simplicity card, and the Citi Simplicity card charges a $95 annual fee.Both of these cards have similar perks, but the Capital One card is cheaper for me to use on a regular basis.I'd like to have a choice between two credit cards that have similar perks, but one of them is much cheaper than the other.If I want to have a credit card with great benefits, I need to choose one with a lower annual fee.

I am a Canadian resident and am interested in opening an account, I am currently looking at the CIBC Advantage MasterCard or the CIBC Rewards Card.Which of these credit cards would you recommend I get?Thank you for your question. I am also in Canada.I have the CIBC Advantage Mastercard and I like it. It is a good no-frills card with no annual fee. I also got a 20% bonus on my CIBC deposits when I switched to this card from another. There are a lot of bonus offers so make sure to read the fine print.I am with you on the no frills card, especially since the CIBC Rewards Card has an annual fee of $15. I've read some great reviews on the CIBC Advantage Card and it sounds like the perfect card for me. I'm hoping to get the bonus as well, although I've only recently started looking into it.As a reminder, I am looking for a good credit card that has the lowest interest rate and is reliable.Thank you for the recommendations. I'm not too interested in the rewards aspect of the card as much as I am in the benefits and stability of the card.I have had the CIBC Advantage Mastercard since 2007, I don't recall there ever being a limit on it, and I have never had problems paying the balance off monthly. The interest rate is a bit high, but as long as you don't carry a balance on the card, it is a good one.I have the RBC card, it has the lowest interest rate, but I pay my balance off in full every month, and there are no perks with it.I don't have the CIBC Advantage Mastercard, but I am familiar with it. It is a great card and the interest rate isn't that bad. The only issue I see with it is that it does not offer a free credit report. There are a lot of cards out there that offer this service, and I personally like the idea of having a credit report for free. It will help me keep my credit score healthy and it also allows me to keep track of my credit card activity.I have been using the CIBC Advantage Mastercard for a number of years now. I've never had any problems with it and I really like the fact that it is a no-frills card. The interest rate isn't that great, but that's not why I'm using it.

It has no annual fee, a decent signup bonus, a 1% cash-back rate for all purchases, and a $95 per year fee for any international transactions.The card also boasts one of the best foreign exchange rates available, making it a great choice if you frequently use your card outside the U.S.What's your favourite credit card? Why?</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. To put things in perspective, the average American household has at least four different credit cards. Some cards are for specific types of purchases, like travel rewards cards. Other cards are good for paying off large amounts of debt because of low interest rates. Still, other cards are used for buying groceries, clothing, and everyday necessities. The best credit card for most people is the one that provides the best value for their unique lifestyle. If you don't think you need four or more credit cards, you're in good company.Do you have a favorite credit card? Let us know what you like about it, or why you think your current credit card is the best in the world.I'm currently only using the Citi AAdvantage MasterCard, so I'm obviously biased. However, I think that it offers a great combination of perks, low interest rates, and financial flexibility. To start, Citi's cardholders get a free companion pass every year. That alone is worth a lot of money, and it makes it possible to travel for free or close to it on the back of a single credit card.I also really like the flexibility of the card. I've never been subjected to a credit check, and I can also carry a balance without getting hit with any interest charges. I've found that this flexibility makes it a great tool for paying off the occasional large expense. Lastly, I really like the perks and benefits of the card, which include lounge access and a 50% discount on airport parking. The AAdvantage MasterCard has its cons too, and I'll be the first to admit that the rewards points program is pretty bad. It takes a long time to earn anything significant, and there are some better programs out there.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card has quickly become my favorite credit card for the following reasons. I get a 50,000 point bonus every time I open a new account, and the points are worth more than you would get with other cards. For example, I can earn $625 in travel rewards for each $4,000 I spend. The credit card also comes with a decent rewards program. I've already used the free travel credits to cover travel expenses, and I like the idea that my rewards will never expire. Finally, the card has the highest purchase and travel protections out of any card I own. It's a great all-around credit card.My favorite card is the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. I love the flexible travel rewards program, but the best part is that I don't have to pay an annual fee. For me, this is a huge perk because I'm a low-income college student. Most cards that I've looked at require a minimum income to waive the annual fee. The Sapphire Preferred Card gives me 2x rewards on travel and dining and it's the perfect fit for my lifestyle.When I first got my credit card, I was told that it was the best card in the world. I didn't believe it at first. It was expensive and hard to use. After a while, I learned that it wasn't so bad. I got rewards, and I had a way to pay for things. The card has been a huge part of my life since then.I use the Capital One Quicksilver Rewards Card for all of my personal expenses. I love that it gives me 1.5% cash back on all purchases and a 10% rewards bonus when I spend at least $5,000 in a year. I also really like that it doesn't charge an annual fee. It has some great features, like no foreign transaction fees, no cash advance fees, and a chip that protects me from fraud.If you're looking for a great credit card, I'd recommend the Chase Freedom Unlimited. The perks of this card are:Unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchasesFree credit score monitoringAccess to Chase's online banking portal, where you can make payments and track your spendingA $100 sign-up bonus when you spend $500 in the first three monthsA 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 monthsNo annual fee, but you must maintain a qualifying direct deposit of $500 or more each month to keep the cardThis card has a lower interest rate than most other cards, and you don't have to worry about being charged for overseas transactions or foreign transaction fees. The biggest drawback is that the rewards are pretty limited. You get 1.5% back on everything you buy, and you can only redeem your rewards for cash or gift cards. You can't use them to book travel or transfer them to another card.If you want a card with more flexibility in how you can redeem your rewards, you should consider getting the Chase Sapphire Preferred or the Chase Sapphire Reserve.I recently switched my main card to the Chase Sapphire Reserve because of the increased value I get from its rewards program. This new card also comes with 1:1 point transfer to Hyatt and United, which is great for me.In order to use this card, you need to have a solid credit history, good credit, and a high income. These requirements are standard for most cards in the United States. I personally use my credit card to make purchases, but I'm not going to go into the specifics of how you use it. If you don't know what a credit card is, it's basically a piece of plastic that allows you to pay for things without cash. You can't take out a loan with it, but you can use it to purchase things and pay them off later.There are different types of cards, including store cards, debit cards, and rewards cards. Each type of card has different benefits and drawbacks, so you should decide which type of card works best for you.The Chase Freedom Unlimited card is a great option for most people. It's not as expensive as other rewards cards, and it offers a lot of benefits. You'll get a $100 sign-up bonus when you spend $500 in the first three months, and you'll earn 1.5% cash back on all purchases. You'll also get no foreign transaction fees, no annual fee, and free credit score monitoring.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card is my favorite because it has a large sign-up bonus, a low APR, no annual fee, and free credit score monitoring. You'll also earn 2x points for every dollar you spend at restaurants and gas stations. The best part is that you can use the rewards to pay for travel, which is something that I love to do.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. It can be the Chase Sapphire Preferred, American Express Gold, or Capital One Venture Rewards\u2014but the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Card may be the right choice for you. This card, while offering a meager welcome bonus of just 20,000 miles, gives you access to a huge range of perks that can add up to some serious value over time.In order to take advantage of everything it has to offer, though, you need to be sure you understand what it does and doesn't include. It's time to find out what makes this a card that's worth your consideration and how it can help you save and earn more.The Capital One VentureOne Rewards Card offers 1.25 miles per dollar spent and a 0% introductory APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 12 months (then 16.99%\u201325.24% variable APR).How Does the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Card Work?In order to fully understand this card, it helps to know a few basic facts about how credit cards work. While you may know how to read a credit card's terms and conditions, the most important thing to know is that your credit card company doesn't actually lend you the money that you spend\u2014it's your credit card issuer that lends you money. They'll charge you a certain interest rate in exchange for lending you that money.As we've mentioned before, a 0% introductory APR is a pretty good deal. With this deal, your purchases will not be charged interest for a set period of time. There are plenty of credit cards that offer introductory 0% interest rates, and this one is a good deal if you plan on spending more than you normally would and paying it off afterward. This can be a great option if you're planning a trip, for instance, and want to get a jump on paying off the cost of it without having to pay the interest.How the VentureOne Rewards Card's Sign-up Bonus WorksThe VentureOne Rewards Card offers a pretty small sign-up bonus\u2014just 20,000 miles. However, when you compare it to other options, it makes the VentureOne Rewards Card a pretty attractive choice. You can easily find credit cards that offer sign-up bonuses of 50,000 miles or more, and the VentureOne Rewards Card makes it possible to have a healthy travel rewards balance fairly quickly.To put that bonus to good use, you'll need to redeem your miles for travel through Capital One Travel, and you can only redeem a minimum of 10,000 miles at a time. The good news is, you can use your miles for a variety of travel-related expenses, and you can also save a ton on travel if you have a decent travel credit card that offers reimbursements for certain travel expenses.Perks You Can Use With the VentureOne Rewards CardAs with any card that comes with benefits, the VentureOne Rewards Card offers some pretty interesting perks. For starters, there's an introductory 0% APR offer that can help you save money on interest and can also give you a bit more financial breathing room if you have an expense that needs to be paid off over time.Another perk you can take advantage of is Capital One Travel.

First, there's a free credit score monitoring feature that can help you keep a closer eye on your credit and see what changes you can make.

If you don't meet that requirement, it may not be the best fit for you.Is the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Card Right for You?There's no one-size-fits-all credit card, and it's important to take a look at the specific features and benefits offered by the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Card to decide whether it's the right card for you.

There is one that has no fee that you should check out.Here's a quick review of two of my favorites that I use.Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Classic for Business is a business rewards card that provides a solid rewards program and a $0 intro APR for the first 6 months.The Capital One\u00ae Spark\u00ae Miles for Business is a business travel rewards credit card with an initial sign-up bonus of 20,000 miles and 0% intro APR for the first 6 months.There is a ton of data on the Internet comparing credit cards and which one offers the best perks for your situation. The best one for me is this one.When choosing a credit card, always look at the APR to determine if the interest is competitive and the terms are acceptable. I've personally been happy with the credit cards that I've chosen and think that you will be, too.You could also consider a personal loan or home equity loan for financing.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I use a Capital One Venture Card for most of my spending and an Amex Platinum for travel, so I'm probably a little biased.I find myself thinking about this a lot more these days because I am getting into investing. I've never done it before, but it's been on my radar for a few years now and I've taken a little more action than normal recently. It's not that I'm going to get rich overnight, but I do think it's important to diversify a little, especially at this stage in my life.My newest venture has been with an investing service called Betterment. They charge 0.25% of your money per year and manage it for you. They claim to make smarter investment decisions than the average person, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and giving them my money to hold and invest.You should know that Betterment is a \"robo-advisor\" which means they automatically adjust and diversify your portfolio, as the market goes up and down. I don't have the knowledge, skill, or the time to make these adjustments on my own, so I am hoping Betterment can improve my results.They are definitely better than nothing, but the returns I've seen so far are a little underwhelming. I'm hoping they will ramp up in the future.The best credit card I know of right now is a no brainer: the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. They've got a great sign-up bonus (50,000 points after spending $4,000 within the first 3 months), a low interest rate (14.49%), and the rewards are good, too (double points on travel and dining).I've read that some people pay off their credit cards in full every month, but I know I'm not one of those people. I pay it off as much as I can, but it never quite reaches zero because we buy stuff, have expenses, and don't quite make enough money to cover all of our living expenses.Even though I pay off my credit card every month, I have never paid interest on it. I use the free-money trick I learned from MoneyBoss.The first step is to find a no annual fee card that gives you a generous sign-up bonus. I use a Capital One Venture card and their current offer is 50,000 points (worth $500) after spending $3,000 in the first 3 months.I get a lot of rewards points on my Capital One Venture card, but I do feel like I'm a little over-extended with 13 credit cards.I'm not sure I've found the perfect credit card yet, but it's hard to beat a no annual fee card with a huge sign-up bonus.I feel like I could do a better job of saving and investing.I think it's important to start as soon as possible.It's hard for me to think about getting older because it seems like it's happening all too quickly, but I know it's happening, and it will continue to happen at a much faster rate from here on out. I'm only 29, but it feels like I'm already middle-aged.It's hard to imagine that in 40 years, I will be almost 70 years old.I've heard that people should save 10% of their income, but I'm not sure I could do that.I think a good goal is to save 5% of your income. That should be easy enough to do if you keep your expenses low, and it will give you a good buffer to fall back on in case you lose your job or get into an unexpected situation.The trick to saving more money is to figure out how you can cut your expenses. The obvious stuff like eating out and buying new clothes is the obvious stuff to cut out of your budget, but you may be able to find other opportunities to reduce your spending.I have a friend who rented a 2 bedroom apartment for a while before she moved to another state. She got a discount because it was off-season and she took a chance on renting a room in someone else's apartment.It worked out well for her because she saved a ton of money on rent and she also met some new people who became friends. If you can find a similar deal, it could be an easy way to save some money.I'm not sure if the math works out, but I think it would be fun to calculate how much money you've saved by doing certain things, like living with your parents. The cost of living seems like it gets higher every year and you have to start planning your retirement before you start saving for it.I'm not sure if the math works out, but I think it would be fun to calculate how much money you've saved by doing certain things, like living with your parents.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. In other words, which is the card to have? I'm guessing this is a card that will offer the most rewards for airfare and hotels.With 2% cash back on all other purchases, the card is more than just for travelers.I've been reading that the Citi Prestige card is the best card for people like myself who fly a lot. It seems that many frequent fliers get the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, as it gives 25% more rewards for travel and other purchases, plus the 1:1 conversion from travel to cash. So my question is which of the two cards offers the best bang for the buck, and why? I'm also curious as to whether there are any other cards out there that are better than either of these. I do not have good credit, so if you could recommend some other credit cards, that would be great too.If you're serious about maximizing your credit card rewards, you've probably been studying up on the subject of travel cards.And you've probably noticed the glaring similarities between the Citi Prestige and Chase Sapphire Preferred cards. They both charge an annual fee of $450. They both offer excellent rewards and some of the best travel perks available. They both have strong travel insurance coverage. And they both earn an easy two cents per dollar on all purchases.So why would anyone want one over the other?I know it sounds like heresy, but I can tell you that I think there are good reasons for choosing one over the other -- and none of them is based on cashback.If you travel frequently, then the Chase Sapphire Preferred card will be better for you.It is the better card for travel, but it will cost you $55 more every year.Let's look at the rewards.If you travel frequently, then the Chase Sapphire Preferred card will be better for you. It is the better card for travel, but it will cost you $55 more every year.While you'll get more cashback overall from the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, you have to understand that rewards are just one way to look at it.The Prestige offers better perks. It includes a statement credit to cover the cost of your Global Entry or TSA PreCheck membership. Global Entry is great because it allows you to zip through U.S. immigration when traveling internationally, saving you a lot of time. TSA PreCheck gives you access to a separate security lane at most U.S. airports.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card doesn't offer these benefits. If you use them regularly, that extra $55 will save you hundreds of dollars.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card doesn't offer these benefits.It also gives you priority boarding and access to airport lounges, and a $250 travel credit after you spend $3,000 in the first six months.The Prestige offers better perks.And if you like the idea of earning airline miles on all your purchases (especially when you don't travel enough to get free flights every year), then the Citi Prestige offers you 5x on airfare and hotels, versus just 2x on the Chase Sapphire Preferred.So, it comes down to this: the Chase Sapphire Preferred is the best card for travel, but you'll get a lot more out of it if you're a frequent traveler. For everyone else, the Citi Prestige is the way to go.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I'm considering two cards -- Chase Sapphire Preferred ($0 annual fee), and Chase Freedom ($0 annual fee).For those unfamiliar with Chase cards, they typically require that you maintain at least $5,000 on the credit card. This amount of monthly income can be met by the average person and it doesn't impact your credit score, which can be a big bonus if you're trying to build credit.You can earn two free nights at any of the Hyatt category 1-4 hotels each year.If you spend $4,000 or more per year, then you'll earn two 25% cash-back bonuses, which can be used to pay down your credit card.You'll earn three points for every dollar you spend on groceries, gas stations, drugstores, restaurants, airfare, and hotels. You'll earn two points for every dollar you spend on all other purchases.You'll earn 2% cash back on up to $1,500 in grocery store purchases each quarter.You'll earn 1% cash back on all other purchases.Chase Freedom is the only one of these cards to require a minimum $5,000 monthly income, but they both offer low interest rates.The Chase Sapphire Preferred also offers two free nights at any Hyatt hotel every year, along with a $0 annual fee.Which card do you think is better?I'm in favor of Chase Freedom for several reasons: First, I've read online that the Chase Sapphire Preferred card doesn't let you transfer your points to other credit cards, which seems to put Chase Freedom in the lead.Second, if I want to redeem my Chase Freedom points on Hyatt hotels, I only need to spend $5,000 in a year and I'll get two free nights per year. If I want to redeem my Chase Sapphire Preferred points on Hyatt hotels, then I'll need to spend $12,000 in a year.Third, Chase Freedom also lets me earn 2% cash back on groceries, which can save me $250 per year. If I want to redeem my Chase Sapphire Preferred points on groceries, then I'd get only 1% cash back.Chase Sapphire Preferred offers two free nights per year, but only for Hyatt hotels and you'll need to spend $12,000 in a year to earn the free nights.Chase Freedom offers two free nights per year, but it also offers 2% cash back on groceries, which can save you $250 per year.Either one of these cards is better than other credit cards I've seen that require a minimum $5,000 income.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. What's most important to you? Do you care more about frequent flier miles, free groceries, or low interest rates? Do you want a card that gives you a lot of options or a card that makes it simple to manage your cash?How do you evaluate credit cards?I've been thinking a lot about how I pick a credit card, and it's clear that there are as many ways to evaluate a credit card as there are cardholders.I'm an avid user of the AmEx Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express. It pays me back 6% for grocery purchases, 3% for gas purchases, and 1% for all other purchases.The grocery benefit is huge for me. I know that, on average, I'm going to save at least $400 on groceries each year (after the $250 spending limit). The low gas benefit doesn't matter to me, because I don't buy gas with a credit card. I like to put everything I can on a credit card, and then pay off my balance each month. I don't carry a balance on the card.I also like that my credit card offers a low interest rate of 10.24% for purchases. It's not a huge benefit, but I like to have that peace of mind that I'm not going to be hit with huge interest payments every month.The American Express Platinum card is popular for a reason -- its benefits are top notch. The $500 airline credit alone makes this card appealing. The card also offers an impressive array of travel benefits, including airport lounge access, an annual airline fee credit, upgrades on airlines and hotels, and more.But it's not perfect. The $450 annual fee may be a bit much. For frequent travelers, the annual fee is worthwhile -- but not everyone can use all of the perks the card offers. If you don't plan on traveling, this card may not make sense.Besides the credit card industry, what other businesses are you considering for a switch to a competitor? What are the factors that most determine your switching decision?I'm considering making a switch from AmEx to Capital One for my grocery credit card. The new Capital One card offers the same 6% rate for grocery purchases. I'd also save money on the annual fee: $0 compared to $75.The Capital One card also offers 2% cash back on restaurants and entertainment, as well as 1% back on everything else. The cash back rewards are good, but I don't see myself using them.My family and I love flying on Southwest Airlines, so we have the Southwest Rapid Rewards Priority Credit Card from Chase.In addition to earning free flights, the card also offers up to 365 days of extended rental car coverage when you rent with Hertz, up to $1,500 in baggage insurance, free in-flight Wi-Fi, and more.It's a great card, but the annual fee is $89 per year. If I'm paying the annual fee anyway, I may as well pay the AmEx fee and earn rewards that I can actually use.If you want to take advantage of low interest rates, you may want to consider a credit card with a low interest rate. I'd recommend the Discover it card. You can qualify for a 0% introductory APR on purchases and balance transfers for six months. After that, the regular APR is a low 10.99% to 22.99%.Another credit card with an outstanding interest rate is the U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa Signature\u00ae Card. With the U.S. Bank card, you'll receive an introductory interest rate of 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for 20 billing cycles. After that, the regular interest rate is 13.99% to 23.99% APR.The interest rate on this card is low, but it's not the only benefit. You can earn 3% cash back at U.S. supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year in purchases). Plus, you'll earn 2% cash back on gas and 1% cash back on all other purchases.The card also offers an introductory APR of 0% APR on balance transfers for 21 billing cycles. After that, the regular APR is 14.49% to 24.49% APR.The Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card is another great card for earning cash back. You'll earn 3% cash back in the category of your choice (gas, groceries, dining, travel, or online shopping). The introductory APR is 0% for 12 months on purchases and balance transfers, and after that, the regular APR is 13.99% to 23.99% APR.If you're not a fan of cash back rewards, you may want to consider another type of rewards card. The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card offers 2X points on dining and travel.The card offers 3X points on other purchases such as groceries and gas. The introductory APR is 0% for 12 months on purchases and balance transfers, and after that, the regular APR is 14.49% to 23.49% APR.Are you satisfied with the credit card you have now?

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I personally use the Chase Sapphire Preferred. I get 2 points per dollar spent on all purchases, and 5 points for travel and dining. There's an annual fee of $95, but it's so easy to get this money back. Also, you get to redeem your rewards through Chase or through one of their partners, like Expedia.If you've got a card and you like it, please do post in the comments. Thanks!I'm actually curious why you chose the Chase Sapphire Preferred over the Chase Ink Business Cash. 5% back on office supply stores, gas, cell phones, land lines, internet, cable and electric. Also, the card has no annual fee. What are your thoughts?The Chase Ink Cash sounds great, but for me, I've got a small business, and I can only really benefit from the bonuses by using it for business purchases. I can't really get to $6,000 in purchases with the card since I'm already using my personal cards for the vast majority of purchases. The Chase Sapphire Preferred is much more versatile, and I'm not spending money on a card to get 1 point per dollar spent for personal purchases.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.The only catch? You're not allowed to use any of your own credit cards!Instead, you must rely solely on the cards you can choose from on this list.There are 4 cards you can choose from.

is a bank issued credit card.You don't have to pay any fees, but you don't earn rewards points either.This card only makes sense if you're looking for a simple, low interest, no-frills credit card

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I'd be interested to know your criteria for what makes a great card and the benefits you're looking for in your card. What are the things you consider important and which cards did you pick and why?For me it has to be low interest rates and no foreign transaction fees. I want a credit card that I can leave in my wallet for the entire time I have it and only use it if I really need to or there's some bonus points I can redeem for travel. The only exception I've found so far is my Discover it Miles which has an annual fee and a higher than 1% foreign transaction fee.I'm wondering what you guys think of these cards and how you would rank them?-The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card offers 50,000 bonus miles when you spend $3,000 on purchases within the first 3 months and gives 2 miles per $1 spent on all purchases.-The Chase Freedom Unlimited offers 3% cash back on all purchases and no annual fee.-The Citi Double Cash card offers 2% cash back when you pay for purchases.-The Citi Simplicity card offers 0% APR for 21 months on balance transfers and for 12 months on purchases. It also offers no penalty APR.I know this is a bit of a cop out and I do think you can definitely get a better card than these, but I'm going to go with a Capital One 360 Money Market.Why? The main thing is the lack of fees. There is no annual fee, no ATM fee, and no fees on out-of-network ATM withdrawals.The interest rate is also pretty decent. This card charges an average of 13.45% to 21.90% (I was recently approved for a card at 16.90%).Lastly, the ability to link it to your savings account makes it a pretty good tool for earning interest while keeping your money in an FDIC-insured account.Any time I can get a no-fee card with a decent interest rate and still have it feel like I'm getting something in return I consider it a big win.I like the Chase Sapphire Preferred, because I'm a loyalty customer and it has a really high sign-up bonus.You do not have to redeem the points for travel-related purchases. If you use the points to redeem for a travel experience, the points have to be used on the same website as the purchase. If not, you get less value for your points.For example, if I buy a $300 flight from Expedia, I can use 3,000 points to cover the flight, but I'm getting a better value if I use the 3,000 points towards a 4-night stay in a $600 hotel. In this example, I'm getting $120 worth of hotel for my $300 flight. I prefer to use the $300 flight on my next flight instead, so I use the points towards the hotel.The other benefit of the Chase Sapphire Preferred card is that I can charge things to my account and then, later, pay it off with the travel points, which I redeem for a cash reward instead of a travel reward. I recently charged $2,000 to my Chase Sapphire Preferred card and paid it off 2 months later. I did not pay any interest on that $2,000 because my card has a 0% introductory rate for purchases.For $95/yr, I get 2x points on travel and dining and 1x on everything else. That gives me a 5.25% return on my spending.And I can take it to the limit every quarter - Chase Sapphire Preferred lets you earn 100,000 points every year by spending $50,000. So if I spend $100,000 in a year, I'll get $2,500 in travel rewards every year ($30,000 * 5.25%).I just signed up for the Capital One Venture Rewards and I'm so excited! 50,000 miles after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first 3 months.I love Capital One Venture Rewards! The main reason is that they have no foreign transaction fees so I can use it abroad without paying extra.The other thing I like about this card is that it lets you earn 1.25x miles on all purchases. So if I spend $3,000 on travel and dining in the first 3 months, I'll earn 3,750 miles. That's a 12.5% return on my spending!I'm considering the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards. 1.5% cash back is pretty high and there's no annual fee. I have a Discover It Miles and that card charges no foreign transaction fees but that comes with an annual fee of $95.I don't think I could live without a cash back card, so for me the best card to have would be a cash back one, no annual fees and the ability to redeem for cash. For me that would be the Chase Freedom Unlimited and I'm pretty much set with it.This would probably depend on my needs at the moment and the type of travel I'm going on. I'd like a credit card with no foreign transaction fees and the Capital One Venture Rewards is currently my favorite one.For me it would be the Chase Freedom Unlimited because it's a cash back credit card and it's easy to use and doesn't charge foreign transaction fees. I don't use my card abroad so it's great to have that feature.My preferred card is the Citi Double Cash card because I don't like annual fees or foreign transaction fees. I think that's a good combination of perks.It depends on what I'm using it for but I'd like to have an annual fee that's low and no foreign transaction fees.I'm all about simplicity with a little extra. My ideal card is the Capital One Venture Rewards card. 50,000 bonus miles after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first 3 months is a pretty good deal.I don't think I could do without a cash back card. I get the Chase Freedom Unlimited and I like the idea of the ability to redeem my rewards for cash. I also don't think I'll ever be in a situation where I'll need a card with a high interest rate.For me it's the Capital One Venture Rewards because it's got a $95 annual fee and 50,000 bonus miles after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first 3 months. I love cash back rewards so this card is a great option.For me it would be a credit card with no annual fees and no foreign transaction fees. My credit cards are my safety net so I don't want to have to worry about extra fees for using them abroad.What are the things you consider important and which cards did you pick and why?For me it's the ability to earn cash back with no annual fees. I've been using the Chase Freedom Unlimited for a while now and it's a pretty good option. I think it's also important to consider whether or not a card will charge you a fee to use it abroad so you don't end up paying more than you have to for using your credit card.I don't know that I'd say these are the best cards in terms of perks, low interest rates, and financial flexibility, but I think they're pretty good. I'm thinking about getting a Chase Freedom Unlimited card for the 1.5% cash back I'll earn on my spending.A cash back credit card would be the best combination for me. That's a pretty straightforward combination and you don't have to worry about foreign transaction fees or interest rates.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. This is a personal finance forum and I would appreciate honest feedback.BTW, I don't own any credit cards.Which credit card offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility?I don't think I can answer that question, but I can tell you which ones I use.Chase United Explorer: The main thing I use this one for is the two miles for every dollar spent and no foreign transaction fees. I love the annual fee waived. I have had this one for 10 years.US Bank Flex Perks Visa: My 2nd favorite credit card. I got the travel accident insurance to cover me and my wife when we travel. Also have the price protection and auto rental insurance. I use it for online purchases and pay for everything with it.FairPoint Visa Signature: This one is good for local grocery store purchases at Hannaford and Shaw's, it has a 15% discount at those stores and gives you one point for every dollar you spend. This was the last one I got because it had no annual fee. I use it for the discount.I have had all of these for 10+ years and have never paid a single penalty for late payments. I would not suggest opening any of them as there is no real benefit other than the perks I stated above.If you are like me and want to go on vacation you do not need to pay interest on it as you will pay it off.This is just my opinion but I would not waste my time. I use a couple of them to get the perks but my main one is the United Explorer and I use it for everything, but online purchases I usually do with my debit card.Most credit cards have a yearly fee that you must pay to use the card. This fee can range from $50 to $100 depending on which card you are getting. You need to find a card that offers you the best perks and doesn't have an annual fee. Some credit cards offer rewards to customers who spend a certain amount every year on the card. This is called cash back. Other credit cards will offer you a certain amount off your purchase every time you use the card for shopping.Some credit cards will have interest rates that are much higher than others. Credit cards can be dangerous to use if you do not have a plan to pay it off every month. If you want to buy a nice big TV on sale at the store but only have $200 then you will end up paying a huge interest rate on your credit card for the rest of the amount you are short. Credit cards are good to use for emergencies if you do not have a large enough emergency fund or for a nice vacation, but you do not want to have to keep paying a huge amount of interest every month for shopping you did earlier.Which Credit Card Is Best?Which is the Best Credit Card for an Emergency?What Is the Best Credit Card?What's the Best Way to Find a Job as a Credit Manager?What's the Best Way to Pay off Your Mortgage Loan?What Is the Best Way to Pay Back Money I Borrowed from a Friend?What's the Best Way to Pay for a Home Renovation?What's the Best Way to Pay Off My Mortgage in 5 Years?</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. If you ask around, most people will probably recommend the Amex Platinum credit card as being the most sought-after credit card among frequent travelers. It offers 60,000 bonus Membership Rewards points after you spend $5,000 within the first 3 months of account opening. Membership Rewards points can be redeemed to book airfare, hotels, car rentals, and even cash-back opportunities. But how does this compare to other credit cards on the market? Are there other options available that are more lucrative for your needs?When I'm looking for a good credit card that allows me to maximize my money, I have a simple checklist that I refer to. I always make sure that the card I'm applying for meets the following requirements:Low interest rates. When choosing a credit card, I like to select a card that has an interest rate lower than 13% for new purchases. This gives me more leeway to use the card if I need to for unexpected travel or car repairs.Annual fee under $50. Annual fees can be over $100 nowadays, and I don't think they are worth paying if you're just using the credit card for its perks. I'll even pay the annual fee to get a credit card with great benefits if I can avoid it.Great perks for me. Perks vary from person to person. What's important to me might not be important to you. I don't get anything out of car rentals, so I don't carry a card that has perks for renting cars. But if you travel a lot, then a good rental car perk might be a must. You can also find perks for dining, shopping, and even more general perks like cash-back opportunities.Rewards program. You don't have to go with a high-end card to get a rewards program. I carry a credit card with a lower annual fee and I get points to use at certain places. But I also earn a small amount of cash-back, which is useful for paying for necessities or even buying the occasional extra.While these requirements are all I ask from a credit card, I'm sure that not all of you are going to agree. Some of you may want a low interest rate, while others might care more about the annual fee and the amount of perks you can get. That's why I'm curious to hear what people think are the best credit cards available.If you could choose any credit card, what would it be? Would you pick the Platinum card or the Citi Prestige?

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I'm in a 12.5% tax bracket, I have a mortgage on my home and have a substantial amount of credit card debt. I've had good luck with Barclaycards in the past and I know that many people like the Chase Sapphire Preferred but I don't think that it is a good fit for me given my financial situation. I'm considering some of the following options, but I would like to hear what you think about other cards before I make a decision:Barclays Arrival (6%)Chase Freedom (7.75%)Amex Everyday (0%)If you've had good luck with any of these cards, or if you've had a card that you've had a similar experience with, please post. I'm a newb, so it'll be helpful if you're able to provide some additional insight.Thanks in advance for your thoughtsApril 24, 2014 at 2:46 PM \u00b7 You have a ton of choices. I'm with you on the Chase Sapphire. To me, it is a bit of an overkill for your situation.Since you're in the 12.5% bracket, the Citi Diamond would be an option (0% for 18 months with a balance transfer fee of 5%, $5k limit).If you like the Barclays, I'd look at the Barclays Rewards as an alternative.April 24, 2014 at 4:32 PM \u00b7 If your goal is the lowest interest rate, there's no question about it - it's the Citi Simplicity.If you can qualify for Amex cards (the Everyday is notoriously hard to get), I'd go with the Blue Cash.April 24, 2014 at 7:57 PM \u00b7 I'm in the same situation as you and I am using the Barclay Arrival (with $2,500 cash back after meeting minimum spending requirements and $100 bonus after first purchase) and the Chase Freedom. With the Chase, you get 5% cash back on purchases with a $1,500 minimum spend per quarter (and you can have 5 active Chase Freedom cards for $100 per card). With the Barclays card, I get $350 cash back after $1,500 spending in the first 3 months. Both cards get you 2% cash back on purchases (up to $1,000 spending per quarter on each card) and a $100 statement credit after making a purchase of at least $1,000 in the first 90 days on each card. The Barclays card is a bit more flexible in the sense that you don't have to meet a minimum spend on each quarter in order to get the cash back. I like the Barclay Arrival more than the Chase Freedom in this case because it gives you $350 for $1,500 spending in the first 3 months (plus $2,500 after meeting the minimum spending requirements) and it gives you 2% cash back on all purchases as opposed to only 5% cash back on purchases with a $1,500 minimum spend per quarter on the Chase Freedom.April 24, 2014 at 10:24 PM \u00b7 The 5% cash back is nice, but you're not earning the cash back on the balance that you are transferring over, which is the debt that you need to pay off most quickly. So while it sounds good, it's probably not the best fit for your situation.April 25, 2014 at 12:55 AM \u00b7 Chase FreedomMay 27, 2014 at 11:34 PM \u00b7 I also just started the Barclay Arrival Plus (0% intro APR for 12 months) and Chase Freedom (0% intro APR for 15 months). If I'm able to pay off my debt in 24 months, I'll still come out ahead, even if I pay interest on a small part of it.August 1, 2014 at 1:10 PM \u00b7 It depends what you want to spend the rewards on. If you are trying to pay off the debt, the Chase Freedom is a great option as long as you keep to the minimum spend requirements. If you are looking for the best travel rewards, then the Chase Sapphire Preferred might be the best option. However, I have the Barclay Arrival Plus and I would say that it is the best credit card in the market for average consumers. The rewards are flexible, easy to use and the card is easy to use. If you use one of the Barclay card, you will probably also use the other two.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I'm currently a long-time customer of Capital One but my loyalty is being tested by the company's decision to significantly raise the interest rate on their most popular product and limit access to cash.If I could, I'd stick with Capital One. I like their no-hassle approach and I prefer to stick with the same bank for my personal finance needs. Unfortunately, I may be forced to switch my spending to another credit card in search of better benefits.Which credit card is your favorite and why?I'm currently a Chase Sapphire Preferred cardholder and love their benefits (2x points for travel and dining, no annual fee, etc.).While there is a $50 fee for a lost card, Chase covers all fraudulent charges (thanks to my mom and her stolen wallet, I've seen that first hand!).The downside is that their rewards program is not as generous as Capital One's. I still use the Capital One card for purchases, though. I like the Capital One card because I'm not required to pay an annual fee, they cover fraudulent charges, and they even send you a new card if it's lost (I believe I can have a new one mailed to me after 10 days, which allows me to cancel the old one in my possession).There are two reasons why I prefer Chase. First, it's a co-branded card (like Marriott Rewards and Ritz-Carlton Rewards). This means that I earn 2X points for all spend on the card. This is a great deal compared to Capital One or Amex.The second reason is the lack of an annual fee, and the $0 fraud liability protection (this is a great benefit, since I've experienced fraudulent charges).</s>",

They allow you to earn rewards, save money on interest, and build your credit score. But with so many options available, it can be difficult to decide which credit card is right for you. Here are some factors to consider when choosing a credit card:If you\u2019re looking for a credit card with the best rewards program, you\u2019ll want to look for one that offers a generous sign-up bonus, high cashback rate, or a combination of the two.If you\u2019re looking for a credit card with the best interest rate, you\u2019ll want to look for one with a low APR and no annual fee.If you\u2019re looking for a credit card with the best overall value, you\u2019ll want to look for one that offers a variety of perks and benefits, such as travel rewards, cashback rewards, and a low APR.Once you\u2019ve decided what you\u2019re looking for in a credit card, it\u2019s important to shop around and compare different options. Be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully, as well as the fine print. And always make sure to use your credit card responsibly, paying your balance in full each month and avoiding late fees.Whether you\u2019re looking for a credit card to help you build your credit score or you just want a credit card with the best rewards program, there are plenty of options available. So don\u2019t be afraid to do your research and find the credit card that\u2019s right for you.We've all been there. You're at the grocery store, about to swipe your debit card, when your mind starts to wander. What if there's not enough money in your account? What if the transaction doesn't go through? What if you have to pay overdraft fees?For some people, this is a recurring nightmare. But for others, it's just a fact of life. And for those who struggle with overdraft fees, there's a solution: a credit card.A credit card can help you avoid overdraft fees because it allows you to borrow money that you don't have in your checking account. When you make a purchase with a credit card, the bank extends you a loan. Then, when you pay off the loan, the bank pays the merchant.Of course, this comes with a price: interest. Interest rates on credit cards are usually high, so you'll want to be careful not to rack up too much debt.But for many people, the peace of mind that comes with a credit card is worth the occasional higher interest rate. If you're someone who struggles with overdraft fees, a credit card can give you the peace of mind you need.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I'm sure many of you have a favorite credit card that you swear by.There are many good ones out there, but the credit cards that I like the best offer low interest rates, no foreign transaction fees, and great travel rewards.The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is my favorite travel rewards credit card.It offers a great deal of flexibility, including the ability to redeem points for travel through Chase or transfer them to partners including United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Marriott, and Hyatt.With the Sapphire Preferred, you'll also get some solid benefits like primary rental car insurance, cell phone insurance, and baggage delay insurance.You can earn a sign-up bonus of 50,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points (worth around $625) when you spend $4,000 in the first three months of owning the card.The only downside is the $95 annual fee.If you can justify the annual fee, the Sapphire Preferred is a card you can use for years to come.When I go abroad, I don't like to think about the potential fees I might have to pay on my credit card. That's why I think the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is the perfect card for travelers.It's one of the few credit cards that doesn't charge foreign transaction fees.It also offers no limits on what you can redeem your points for, including redeeming them for travel as a statement credit.This is one of the few cards I'd recommend carrying a balance on, as you'll earn 1.25 miles for every dollar you spend (up to $10,000 in purchases a year).You'll also earn a one-time bonus of 40,000 miles when you spend $3,000 in the first three months of owning the card.This bonus is worth around $400 in travel and is easy to earn because Capital One doesn't count any transfer partners as foreign transactions.You'll pay a $95 annual fee, but I think it's worth the benefit of not paying foreign transaction fees.While the Sapphire Preferred is my go-to credit card for travel rewards, I also like to carry a card for everyday use.That's why I like the Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express, which offers 6% cash back at US supermarkets on up to $6,000 in purchases annually and 3% back on gas stations and select US department stores.The card also offers 1% back on all other purchases.When you factor in the 0% introductory interest rate for purchases and balance transfers, this is a great everyday card for those who need flexibility in their financial life.It does carry an annual fee of $95, which makes it one of the most expensive everyday cards on the market.But if you can afford to pay it, it's a great deal.This article was updated on February 6, 2019.</s>",

We also found that they give you more for your points than most others, so that may have helped.The Chase Sapphire Reserve is a great card but I've found that the Chase Freedom card has provided the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility for my needs. The flexibility is probably the biggest draw because it allows me to earn cash back on all of my purchases, not just travel. The cash back with the Freedom Unlimited is the biggest draw, but I also like the unlimited access to airport lounges.I think that's a good point.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I'm a little confused with all of the various options.There's also the Chase Sapphire Preferred (http://www.chase.com/credit-cards/credit-cards/sapphire-preferred) which seems to be one of the best.As you might imagine, we have a lot of readers here with strong opinions on the subject. Let us know which credit card is your favorite and why!It's no surprise that I picked the AMEX Blue Cash card. With a 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else, you can do a lot of shopping and earn a decent amount. On the other hand, Chase has a great card, but I'd rather pay the 4% interest rate over the 2% cash back.If you're interested in getting a credit card, check out our best credit cards page which will point you in the right direction.Best Credit Card for Everyone?What's the Best Credit Card for Everyone?Readers, what's the best credit card that offers a low interest rate, no annual fee, and cash rewards? Please let us know in the comments.While there are a number of credit cards with no annual fees, few have the features of the AMEX Blue Cash. The interest rate is also very competitive.We need to distinguish between a rewards credit card and a cash back credit card. If you need to carry a balance for several months and plan to make some purchases for which you would like cash back, then the cash back cards are definitely for you. If you need a card with lower interest rates for carrying a balance, then a card like the Citi DoubleCash is better. The reason is that if you carry a balance over several months, you are not only paying a higher interest rate, but also paying interest on interest.Cash back cards are best for those who do not carry a balance over several months. There are cards like this which don't charge you interest if you pay your balance in full.As for cash back cards, there are two main types. One is for purchases only, while the other allows you to earn rewards on certain purchases. For example, the Citi ThankYou Preferred is a card which allows you to earn a 10% bonus on purchases at Citi Supermarkets and Supercenters. It also has a 1% cash back reward on other purchases. This is similar to the Chase Freedom card, which also offers rewards on certain purchases. If you prefer a no fee card, check out the Discover It card, which has a 5% cash back bonus on purchases in certain categories.I'd like to hear what readers think. Are there other credit cards that have cash back rewards and no annual fees?I'm thinking about getting the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, but I'm a little confused about the annual fees.I'm trying to decide if it's worth paying the annual fees if the points will be able to cover it in the future, or if I should just avoid the annual fees entirely. Any thoughts on this?</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.While no credit card is ever truly free, the Chase Sapphire Preferred is about as close as you'll find. If you can find a no-fee credit card, you'll typically find that it doesn't provide as many perks as the Chase Sapphire Preferred.The card comes with a $0 annual fee and a competitive APR of 15.24 percent to 24.24 percent (variable), based on your creditworthiness. The card also gives you up to 50,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 in three months.I find the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is the ideal card to use in place of a debit card because it offers many benefits, such as rewards, travel insurance, and more. I also prefer it because it does not charge an annual fee.Although there's no doubt that the Chase Sapphire Preferred card is a top contender for the best no-fee card, it's not without some drawbacks. For example, you may find that its high rewards rate is only valuable to frequent travelers who prefer to book through Chase's Ultimate Rewards website. You could also run into a situation in which your card isn't accepted, since it isn't part of Visa or MasterCard networks.If you're looking for a credit card with low interest rates, the Chase Freedom Unlimited Card is for you. The card offers a 0 percent intro APR for the first 15 months and then a variable 15.24 percent to 24.24 percent (after the introductory period ends).Although the Chase Freedom Unlimited Card doesn't have an annual fee, it does come with a few cons, such as the fact that you don't receive the same cash back benefits as you would with some of the other cards on this list. This means that if you spend a lot of money on gas, dining out, or entertainment, then this card is probably not going to be your best option.If you're willing to pay a little bit of a fee for perks, then the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card might be the card for you. It has a competitive APR of 14.49 to 23.49 percent (variable) and a welcome bonus of $150.One of the perks of the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card is that it can be used anywhere that accepts Visa, which is good if you travel frequently. You'll also find that the card comes with a nice rewards rate of 2 percent on dining and entertainment.Although the card offers a lot of advantages, such as free credit score monitoring and an excellent rewards rate, there are a few drawbacks to keep in mind. For example, you'll find that your credit limit is a little bit lower than other cards on this list, and it's limited to $100 in cash back rewards in a month.The Citi Double Cash Card is a good option if you are looking for a credit card that doesn't have an annual fee. In addition to being free, the card also offers some nice perks, including a 1 percent cash back rate on all purchases and a 0 percent intro APR for the first 12 months.You should be aware that the Citi Double Cash Card does not have the same perks as other cards on this list. For example, you'll find that there is no rewards program, so you'll need to do a lot of your own research to figure out how to get the most value out of your purchases.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. What would be your personal choice?For me, I love Chase's Sapphire Preferred card which offers a 2% cash back rate, access to Chase's airport lounge network (including AmEx Centurion lounges), and an annual $50 travel reimbursement after spending $3,000 in a year. However, in recent years, Chase's offerings have changed and I've had to cut back a bit. For example, I don't have access to their airport lounges because I'm not a Chase checking account customer. I don't have $3,000+ in spending in a year for my travel reimbursement and the cash back I earn in the card has never paid for anything more than an airport food coma.So, I'm curious to know what credit card would be your first choice? What perks do you get? What rates are you locked into? What interest rates are you paying and how much interest would you like to eliminate?Re: Your #1 Choice Credit CardPost by djpetesky \u00bb Tue Nov 21, 2017 6:41 pmI don't have a primary credit card. I have one for emergencies in case my debit card doesn't work, but I also carry cash and don't like using cards as my primary payment method.Post by TGD \u00bb Tue Nov 21, 2017 6:48 pmI have a Citi AAdvantage World Elite Mastercard that I use almost exclusively for travel. I do have a second, secondary Chase Sapphire Preferred that I used when I was traveling for work more, but haven't used in years.Post by sscritic \u00bb Tue Nov 21, 2017 6:54 pmI use a Chase Freedom Card that earns 5% cash back on rotating categories (up to $1500 in purchases per quarter). That gives me about $150 in cash back per quarter, which I have found to be a useful source of income.I use a Capital One Venture card for travel. I earned enough miles for a one-way ticket to London and a one-way ticket from Los Angeles to Boston.For most of my credit card use, I use the Bank of America Visa (2.6% rebate for $1000 or more per month). I have a $500 credit line and don't have to pay a penalty for paying it off early (I always pay it off every month). I also get a 0% intro rate. I like having a good Visa.If I had to choose, the best would be the Bank of America Visa. I would prefer to have more miles to fly, but I like this card better. I've never had to worry about getting banned for credit card abuse. I also don't have to pay annual fees or penalty fees if I pay off the card early. I think the 0% intro rate is valuable. It allows me to spend a few hundred bucks I may not otherwise spend.Post by dbr \u00bb Tue Nov 21, 2017 6:56 pmI have a Chase Sapphire Preferred that I like very much, except that they seem to arbitrarily shut down a cardholder's account every few years. This happened to me twice in recent years, and once to my spouse. The last time it happened to me, it took about two months to restore service.I have another, very old, Chase Visa that I occasionally use, but it is not a primary card for me.The only other primary card I have is a Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select that I also like, though it does not come close to the Sapphire Preferred in any of its features.I have a Bank of America credit card that I like. I have used it for emergency expenses and not had to pay a late payment fee.I used to have the Chase Freedom card and the Chase Sapphire Preferred. I've had to cut back because Chase has changed how they operate.I do believe that if I were to get a new card, it would be the Chase Freedom Unlimited card.Post by rkhusky \u00bb Tue Nov 21, 2017 7:01 pmsscritic wrote: \u2191I just had to cancel my Chase Freedom card and transfer out.

In the last few years I have been issued several cards by Chase, but never a Freedom. I had to call Chase to find out what the Freedom is. When I get another Chase card it will be the Sapphire. I like the idea of 2% back on everything and the free airport lounge access. I also like that Chase has not shut down any of my cards in the last 10 years.Post by The Wizard \u00bb Tue Nov 21, 2017 7:27 pmA few years ago, Chase had a promotion where you could earn 50k Chase points (now I think it's 60k Chase points) in a year. I figured it would be fun to do.My choice was the Chase Sapphire Preferred. However, my wife was denied the Chase Sapphire Preferred because she got the offer 2 weeks earlier than me. I had to use the Ink Preferred instead because I was late to the party and missed out.It turned out that I actually like the Ink Preferred better than the Chase Sapphire Preferred. I got the Ink Preferred when it first came out and the Ink Unlimited when that card was introduced.The Chase Sapphire Preferred offers 2 points per dollar for everything. You can redeem the points for 1.25 cents each. However, you have to pay $1,000 every year in purchase to get the 2 point rate. You will get 1.5 points per dollar if you pay more than $1,000 every year.The Ink Preferred is my favorite. I'm getting 2 points for everything. I can redeem the points for 1.25 cents each, or I can get 1.5 points for every dollar I spend on business related purchases. I can redeem the points for $50 at Amazon or $75 at Home Depot. The latter is useful for getting things shipped for free.The Ink Unlimited has a 1.5 points for every dollar spent rate. However, you get 1.25 cents per point for redemption and the Ink Unlimited does not get you the 1.5 points per dollar rate if you spend more than $1,000 every year.I find the Ink Preferred to be better than the Chase Sapphire Preferred in nearly every way, except for the $1,000 annual spending requirement.I use all 3 Chase cards as primary cards.Post by The Wizard \u00bb Wed Nov 22, 2017 9:21 amsscritic wrote: \u2191 I do believe that if I were to get a new card, it would be the Chase Freedom Unlimited card.Post by sc9182 \u00bb Wed Nov 22, 2017 10:34 amPost by Mister Imperceptible \u00bb Wed Nov 22, 2017 12:42 pmI was a Chase Ink Unlimited customer (and now ex-customer) for many years. I liked the 1.5X for all categories and then 2X on the first $150,000 spent on travel and shipping/online purchases per calendar year. It worked out really well for me (and Chase) - my rewards were almost always $150,000 or less.I still had a Sapphire Preferred card - it was a gift from Chase after my Ink account closed. So, I used that card to earn the 50,000 points. Chase didn't like me having 2 Chase Visa cards, so they closed my Sapphire Preferred account.I'm an AmEx guy now. I have the Blue Cash Everyday card and the Platinum card. The Blue Cash is a no-brainer for me - 6% on groceries, 3% on gas, and 1% on everything else. If you have a targeted offer for a big sign-up bonus, you can get a lot of $ back from groceries alone.The Platinum card has many benefits, but the one I use the most is the Centurion lounge access. They are great lounges, and if I have a long layover with kids, it can be a lifesaver. I'll also use it for other perks like room upgrades or free breakfast.Post by sc9182 \u00bb Wed Nov 22, 2017 3:31 pmThe Wizard wrote: \u2191 I just had to cancel my Chase Freedom card and transfer out.

I believe the reason for closing accounts is if they see you opening and closing a lot of cards, they think you're a churner.I've never had a churning problem, but I'm on my 3rd bank and credit card in as many years. And that's just because I got an offer I couldn't refuse.I got 60,000 United miles when I applied for their credit card. I also get 2 miles per $1 spent and I have two roundtrip upgrades and three night stays that I can use whenever.</s>",

I like the card and it\u2019s been pretty good to me. There are some drawbacks, however.The main drawback is the annual fee. I pay $60 a year for this card. It\u2019s not too bad, but it\u2019s not great either.The second drawback is the points system. I\u2019m not really a points guy. I like the miles better because they can be converted into flights. But the Venture card only gives you points that can be used for statement credits.The last drawback is the travel insurance. It\u2019s not really that great. It only covers certain things and only for certain countries.Overall, the Venture card is a good option. The annual fee is reasonable, the points system is fair, and the travel insurance is adequate. But if you\u2019re looking for a no-fee travel card, there are better options out there.I\u2019ve been a Capital One Venture card holder for about two years now.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.Here's a breakdown of some of my favorite offers:\u2022 0% APRYou can lock in a 0% APR for 6 months with the BankAmericard Credit Card. You don't even have to have a Bank of America checking account to qualify. You will need to make a minimum monthly payment of $10 (the card has no annual fee).\u2022 Rewards programThe Barclaycard Ring MasterCard offers a rewards program that allows you to earn 1 point for every $1 spent (or 2.25% cash back) on purchases. You can also earn bonus points for online shopping and gas purchases. Points can be redeemed as cash back, gift cards or donations to charity.\u2022 15% cash backThe American Express Cash Back Credit Card offers a simple way to earn 15% cash back at stores and on purchases (or 10% at restaurants and for travel) with no annual fee.\u2022 Free TSA PreCheck membershipThe Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier Credit Card gives you an automatic TSA PreCheck membership ($85 value) for the life of your card membership. You'll also earn double the Rapid Rewards points on Southwest Airlines purchases.\u2022 $50 cash back bonusYou'll get a $50 cash back bonus after making $500 in purchases within the first three months of card membership.\u2022 2% cash back at restaurantsThe Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express offers 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets on up to $6,000 in spending per year (then 1%). You'll also earn 3% cash back on select U.S. streaming services, transit, and gas and 1% cash back on other purchases.Which card do you like best?</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I've been using the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card for several years now and love its low interest rate (1.99%), 2% cash back on purchases, and ability to transfer cash to a wide variety of frequent flyer programs and hotel rewards programs. However, a reader recently told me he prefers the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card because of its flexible travel rewards program.And with so many options on the market (including the new Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express), I wanted to see what you think is the best credit card available. Let us know which card you prefer, and if you have any comments about the survey, please feel free to share them below.It appears that the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card has been selected by a plurality of readers. Interestingly, this card has the highest average credit limit and the highest average interest rate among all cards listed, yet people appear to like its rewards and low interest rate.While the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card seems to offer the best combination of perks and low interest rate, I think many readers may not know that they can earn cash back on their purchases. For example, a Capital One representative told me that customers using the VentureOne Credit Card are earning 10 times more cash back than customers using other major travel cards. You can earn 1.25% cash back on everything, which adds up to a whopping $4,000 per year. The VentureOne Credit Card also offers a lower interest rate (11.24%-21.24%) and no foreign transaction fees.What's the best credit card available?I have two questions: 1) why didn't the Citi Hilton HHonors Card make the cut, and 2) do you find the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express to be a good alternative to the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card?The Citi Hilton HHonors Card was removed from the survey since we don't accept credit cards that offer airline mileage or car rental bonuses. This is an issue of fairness because we're only asking readers to select the credit card they feel offers the best combination of perks and low interest rates.There is an exception, however, to our rule about airline mileage bonuses. We've listed the Starwood Preferred Guest American Express Card because it offers some of the best travel perks and is one of the few cards that is not affiliated with a major airline.I haven't tested the Blue Cash Preferred Card, but it does appear to offer some of the best cash back on purchases for certain people. It charges an annual fee of $75, and offers 3% cash back on certain purchases. If this card works for your spending habits, it's probably the best deal available.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I'm currently considering the Chase Freedom card, which offers 5% cash back for groceries, gas, dining, and drugstore purchases up to $1,500 per quarter (then 1% thereafter). Does this seem like a good offer, or is there something better out there? I appreciate your thoughts.There are a number of different credit cards out there with a variety of different perks, rewards, and features. If you're considering the Chase Freedom, I think it's a pretty great card to have in your wallet.The Chase Freedom offers 5% cash back on groceries, gas, dining, and drugstores. This is quite a bit more than what many other cash-back cards offer. It also has no annual fee, and the ability to earn an unlimited amount of cash-back.One of the most important things to know about cash-back cards, and the Chase Freedom specifically, is that you'll earn that cash back on purchases you've made, minus what you've already earned. So if you've spent $2,500 in the first quarter of the year, you'll earn $125 in cash back. The $125 in cash back will automatically go into your bank account, and you'll be able to use it for whatever purpose you like.One of the things that I like most about the Chase Freedom is that it doesn't have an annual fee, which is a huge benefit for me. You'll earn 5% cash back on your purchases for the first $1,500 you spend per quarter, and then 1% thereafter. So if you spend $2,000 per quarter, you'll earn a total of $150. If you spent $2,500, you'd earn $125.One of the most important things you can do with your credit cards is to pay off your balances every month. That way, you'll not only be saving money on interest, but you'll also be earning cash back.As far as interest rates go, I would recommend that you shop around to find the best one for you. There are many different options out there, and you'll want to find one that works best for you and your needs.What should my next steps be?There are a lot of different things you should keep in mind when you're comparing different credit cards. But the one thing that I think is most important to remember is that you'll be earning cash back on your purchases, minus what you've already earned.So, for example, if you spend $2,000 in the first quarter of the year, you'll earn $125 in cash back. If you spent $2,500, you'd earn $125. If you spent $2,000 in the second quarter, you'd earn $75. And if you spent $2,500 in the third quarter, you'd earn $65.If you were to add it all up, you'd earn $125 in cash back on your first $3,000 in purchases, $75 on your second $3,000, $65 on your third $3,000, and $50 on your fourth $3,000.As far as interest rates go, I would recommend that you shop around to find the best one for you. There are many different options out there, and you'll want to find one that works best for you and your needs. You'll also want to check out the different terms and conditions of each card. This will help you determine what card is best for you.I would also recommend that you consider the different features each card offers. For example, some cards have no annual fee, while others do. Some cards have more perks than others. Some cards have more rewards than others. Some cards have lower interest rates than others.So, as far as what you should do next, I think it's important to shop around, compare different credit cards, and figure out what works best for you. You'll want to compare features, annual fees, interest rates, perks, rewards, and more.Once you've done that, you'll have a much better idea of which credit card is the best one for you.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I was surprised to see the Amex Delta cards topping the list of the best cards based on the benefits they offer. My only concern about that type of card is that the company is too aggressive in selling its cards. For example, a friend of mine who has been a loyal customer for many years has received several solicitations in the last year. She is not interested in changing banks. But I don't know if the company's pushiness would bother you.Also, I have a question about Amex. I understand that the company is currently in the process of acquiring Simmons Mattress, one of the nation's largest suppliers of mattresses. If Amex can be so aggressive in selling mattresses, what will it do to promote the sales of its credit cards?The Amex Delta cards are a great deal for people who are heavy flyers, but I also like the Starwood American Express card. I've been a loyal customer for a few years and enjoy all the perks it offers. And as for selling mattresses, my brother has been dealing with that company for 20 years or so and has never had a bad experience with Amex.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. The list of options is pretty long: There are cards that give you 0% interest for up to 15 months (and then only 13.99% after that), cards that offer free flights on their anniversary date, cards that give you a discount on movie tickets, cards that offer a free rental car on your birthday, cards that give you a cash back bonus for everyday purchases, cards that waive foreign transaction fees, cards that give you a 10% discount on Amazon, and so on.If you can afford to pay your balance off in full every month, the best card for you is probably one with a great rewards program. For example, I recently opened a Discover More Card with 5% back on rotating categories, like gas stations and restaurants. If you don't have the cash to pay off your bill in full every month, it makes sense to find a card with the lowest interest rate possible. For example, I've seen a card with 0% APR for the first 15 months and then only 13.99% after that. But it's possible to find an even lower rate with a card like the Bank of America's Travel Rewards card.All of these options, as well as some that haven't been mentioned, are available on BestCards.com.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. It's hard to determine the right one for you when there are so many options out there.I want to start with a disclaimer. I am NOT an expert on credit cards. I am just your everyday guy, a regular consumer who does his research and tries to make informed decisions.Before getting started, you might want to first check out this post about the basics of credit cards.Here are the credit cards that I'm currently considering. Feel free to share your thoughts and offer your own advice and suggestions.Discover it: This card offers 0% for 6 months on purchases, followed by a low rate of 10.99% for 6 months. If you pay in full each month, you'll avoid all interest charges.You will also earn 5% cash back in rotating categories, up to $1,500 spent per quarter. These categories change every quarter, and can include anything from gas to dining out to groceries.In addition, you can earn 1% cash back on everything else you buy.Chase Freedom Unlimited: You will earn 1.5% cash back on everything you buy (except on purchases that earn bonus cash back with another card). The card also offers 0% for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers.Citi Double Cash: Earn 2% cash back on every purchase. The card also offers 0% for 18 months on purchases and balance transfers.Citi Simplicity: Earn 0% for 21 months on purchases and balance transfers.Finding the right card really boils down to your individual needs and preferences. You have to decide what is most important to you.For example, if you tend to carry a balance from month to month, then it makes sense to look for a card with a low interest rate. If you're looking to earn rewards, then that should be your top consideration.I'm currently leaning toward the Discover it, because I like the idea of rotating categories. I don't think that the cash back amount is as significant as the bonus categories. I'd rather earn 5% back on gas, groceries, or dining out, rather than 1% on everything else.I'd love to hear your thoughts on these or other cards, and I'd be happy to share my final decision with everyone after I've had a chance to use the new card for a while.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. Here's my short list of the top 5 best credit cards, but it doesn't mean that these are the best for everyone. So please share your own opinions in the comments section.1. Citi Forward Card with ThankYou PointsProbably the best all-around credit card is Citi Forward with ThankYou Points, which has one of the highest cash back rates around:0% APR for 12 months on purchases.1% cash back on all purchases.$200 sign-up bonus for new cardholders.2. Chase Freedom Card2.5% cash back on the first $1500 spent each quarter at one of 5 different merchants of your choosing.0% APR for 15 months on balance transfers.3. USAA Visa Card6.25% cash back on all gas and grocery purchases.0% APR for 18 months on balance transfers and 0% APR for 6 months on purchases.$200 sign-up bonus if you spend $1000 in your first 3 months.4. PenFed Visa Signature Rewards2.5% cash back on the first $1500 spent each quarter at one of 5 different merchants.5. Capital One Cash Rewards5.0% cash back on all purchases for the first 6 months.3.0% cash back on gas and supermarkets for the first 6 months.0% APR for 12 months on balance transfers.2.5% cash back for new cardholders for the first 6 months.Citi ForwardI believe that the Citi Forward is one of the best credit cards for everyday purchases, and I'm sure that I'm not alone. With this card you can get 1% cash back for everything, no matter where you're shopping or who you're buying from. This cash back rate is very competitive, and in fact, it is one of the highest rates in the market today.In addition to this cash back rate, you also get a sign-up bonus of $200 if you spend $1000 within the first 3 months of becoming a new cardholder. You get an additional $250 if you have at least 3 other people (other than yourself) sign up for the Citi Forward, and you receive an additional $200 if you refer 3 more people to the Citi Forward, making your total sign-up bonus $650.In addition to this bonus cash back rate, the Citi Forward also gives you an introductory 0% APR on balance transfers for 12 months. The card does not have an annual fee, but you can make 5% balance transfers with a fee of $5 or 3% balance transfers with a fee of $5 or 2%.Because of its 1% cash back rate, 18-month 0% APR on balance transfers, and introductory 12-month 0% APR on purchases, the Chase Freedom Card is probably the best card for someone with a substantial amount of debt. I think it is especially good if you have large medical expenses.The Chase Freedom card is a \"category card\", so you can earn extra cash back if you choose specific merchants where you do a lot of shopping. Every quarter, you choose the merchants that you shop at most, and you get a percentage back on every dollar you spend. You get 1.5% cash back on one of the five merchants of your choice. The other 3 merchants are chosen at random, and you will get 1.0% cash back for purchases at these merchants. The merchants change every three months, so you'll have a chance to try out new places to shop.Here is a list of all of the 5 merchants and their rewards for 2009:Food & Drug Stores (includes restaurants) - 5%Automotive Maintenance/Repair - 5%Home Improvement - 5%Department Stores - 5%General Merchandise - 5%You will get a cash bonus of $150 if you spend $500 in the first 3 months. If you refer 2 other people to sign up for the Chase Freedom Card, you will get an extra $50 cash bonus. If you refer 10 other people to sign up for the Chase Freedom Card, you will get a $100 cash bonus.I believe that USAA is one of the best credit cards in the market, and I think that their Visa Signature Rewards card is the best card for a USAA member, because of its 6.25% cash back on gas and groceries. This is in addition to its 1% cash back rate on all other purchases. The 6.25% gas and grocery cash back rate is really good, and it is much higher than most other cash back credit cards.The USAA Visa card also offers you 0% APR for 18 months on balance transfers. If you are interested in getting a balance transfer, you will have to contact USAA by phone for more information. USAA will not tell you the details of its balance transfer offer, and they will not transfer any balance transfers until you talk to a live person at USAA.This is the perfect credit card for anyone who spends a lot of money at the gas station or grocery store, and I think that this card should be an important part of any financial plan. You have to be a USAA member to get this card, but if you are a military member or the spouse or dependent child of a military member, then you are probably eligible for USAA membership.This is a great cash back card for someone who spends a lot of money at grocery stores or gas stations. In addition to its 1% cash back rate on all purchases, you also get 5.0% cash back for the first 6 months on gas and supermarkets.You get a sign-up bonus of $200 if you spend $1000 in the first 3 months. If you spend an additional $1000 in the next 3 months, you get an additional $250. If you refer 3 people to become new PenFed cardholders, you will receive an extra $200 cash bonus. If you refer 10 people to become new cardholders, you will receive an extra $250 cash bonus. If you get your spouse, parents, grandparents, or any other relatives to sign up for the card, you can get a $200 referral bonus for each relative who signs up.5. Capital One Cash RewardsI believe that the Capital One Cash Rewards card is one of the best credit cards for everyday shopping. You get a 5.0% cash back rate for the first 6 months, which means that you will be able to save a lot of money. The introductory 5.0% cash back rate is especially good if you do a lot of shopping at places like Wal-Mart, Target, or Kmart.Capital One will not tell you the details of its bonus cash back rate until you have talked to a live person. To qualify for the 5.0% cash back rate, you have to make at least 2 purchases per week. Capital One will not tell you which purchases you need to make to qualify for the 5.0% cash back rate, and they will not give you a cash bonus until you make your first purchase.Capital One will not let you transfer your balance to the Capital One Cash Rewards card until you have a credit score of at least 720. Capital One has a different credit score range than the rest of the credit card companies, and if you have a low credit score, then Capital One might not let you transfer your balance.6.0% cash back for the first 6 months, which is especially good for grocery and gas purchases.This is a great cash back card for anyone who spends a lot of money at the grocery store, but it does not offer as high of a cash back rate as the USAA card. This card also has a 0% APR for 12 months on balance transfers.I don't think that this card is the best card for a USAA member, because USAA offers a higher cash back rate and a lower 0% APR for balance transfers.What's the best credit card for you?I don't think that the best credit card is for everyone. If you have good credit and are able to pay off your credit card balance each month, then I think that any of the above cards will be great for you. But if you are just starting out and have a low credit score, then I don't think that any of the above cards are going to be the best choice for you.If you have poor credit, then I would recommend that you look at the Capital One card. It is the only card that allows you to make a balance transfer even if you have a low credit score. This card has a lower cash back rate than other cash back credit cards, but it has a higher 0% APR for balance transfers.If you don't mind spending some time learning how to manage your money, then I think that you should look at the USAA Visa Signature Rewards card. This card has the highest cash back rate that I've ever seen, and it also has a lower 0% APR for balance transfers. This card is not available to everyone, and you have to be a USAA member to get it. But if you do sign up for the USAA Visa card, I think that it will be well worth your time.What's the best credit card for you? Let me know in the comments section below.What's the best credit card for you? I've used all of the cards on my list, and I think that the Citi Forward is the best card for everyday purchases. It has a 1% cash back rate for everything, and it also has a 18-month 0% APR for balance transfers. If you spend a lot of money at gas stations or grocery stores, then I think that the USAA Visa card is the best card for you. It has a 6.25% cash back rate on gas and groceries, and it also has a 0% APR for balance transfers. If you're looking for a great cash back rate, then I think that the Capital One Cash Rewards card is the best card for you. It has a 5.0% cash back rate for the first 6 months, which is especially good for grocery and gas purchases.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. You know, the best-of-the-best credit card.I've put together the results of my own little poll in this post, and I'd love to hear your thoughts as well.I believe the Best-Of-The-Best Credit Card would have a relatively low interest rate, with the flexibility to carry a balance without having to pay a fee. I'd also like the ability to earn cashback rewards on my purchases, and possibly enjoy some perks such as travel insurance.What would you include as key features of the Best-Of-The-Best credit card?When considering the Best-Of-The-Best credit card, which of these features is most important?What does the best-of-the-best credit card have?How often do you use your credit card?How much do you carry on your credit card?Which statement below best describes your credit score?I would like to have my credit score improved.What other features would you include on your Best-Of-The-Best credit card?What do you think? Are there any key features you'd include on the Best-Of-The-Best credit card? If so, share them with us!I think I\u2019m going to go with the RBC Avion Visa. It has a 1.99% rate, a 15,000 sign up bonus, and you get to pay with any Canadian credit card. I think that\u2019s the best combination of perks, low interest rates and financial flexibility.I like this blog a lot. I think you should look into your BBB card. It sounds like you are describing my credit card with your poll. I also get to use a Canadian credit card and it has no fee. If I am going to carry a balance, which I do often, I don\u2019t want to pay more in interest than I have to. I don\u2019t travel internationally but I love the insurance. I would take this poll again.Hey Nicole \u2013 Thanks for the comment. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what\u2019s the best part of your Avion Visa?I don\u2019t mind. I think the flexibility is the best part. The 1.99% rate is great but it\u2019s a rate only. If I\u2019m going to pay something, I want to pay something small. The 15,000 sign up bonus is also great. It\u2019s great because it\u2019s not too much but it\u2019s more than the minimum. And finally, if I have a choice between a Canadian credit card and an international one I would choose the Canadian one every time.Hi Nicole, thanks for commenting. I agree \u2013 the flexibility of the Avion Visa is really nice. And the signup bonus is definitely one of the most appealing features.I think the Avion Visa is the best credit card. The interest rate is only .99% and you can use your Canadian credit card anywhere. I also like the fact that I can earn more than just the 1.99% interest rate. I like that I can choose any of the different types of rewards such as cash back or travel miles. This card also has no balance transfer fee, no annual fee and no foreign transaction fee.I think the best credit card has the most benefits.I\u2019m curious to see the results of this poll.I am really glad you asked this question! I think we\u2019re all getting more and more confused by the plethora of credit cards out there. What makes this one the best for me may not make it the best for you. And, if your credit score is not good enough to get approved for this card, then what are you to do?As for my best credit card, I have no idea what you have in mind, so I don\u2019t know which one is best for me.You could always have a credit score of 700 and get rejected for a credit card because they think you\u2019re too risky!I find that when I go looking for credit cards, they are all marketed at me, and I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re good for me. So I don\u2019t want to spend too much time comparing. I just want to find a card that\u2019s good for me.I\u2019m with Kirsten on this one. We all know what is good for us. There is a reason why there are so many credit cards out there. If I can only choose one card, it\u2019s going to be my best one. I can still be frugal if I know the card gives me perks. So I can\u2019t compare and see which is best for me. That\u2019s why I just go for it. If I can get approval for it, I\u2019ll be happy to have it.I\u2019m with Kirsten and Debra on this. I\u2019ve found that the credit card I currently have works great for me. There are times when I may need to do a balance transfer, but that is the only time I use my card. I can always find a way to pay for things and use cash or a debit card. That is why I am not interested in a balance transfer card.I am a person who likes to save money. That\u2019s why I choose the Scotiabank Momentum Visa card. I have been with them for years and I like their cash back perks. I like that I can transfer my rewards into my Scotiabank bank account and use it for whatever I want. They also offer a lot of different perks including insurance and car rental protection. I think that is really nice. I would say that the Scotiabank Momentum Visa card is the best credit card out there right now.If I\u2019m going to be carrying a balance I want to be sure to use my Scotiabank Momentum Visa as it has the lowest rate on the market and the flexibility to use anywhere in the world and I can save even more money by earning the 5% cashback in categories I spend in!That is why I would say the Momentum Visa is the best of the best credit card.There\u2019s definitely a lot of confusion with all the credit cards out there.I\u2019m with you guys \u2013 I believe the Scotiabank Momentum Visa card is the best choice. What do you think?I am a little nervous about carrying a balance. It is never a good thing. If I have to carry a balance I would rather it was as low as possible. So I think the best credit card would have the lowest interest rate possible, and I would also like to get a credit card that offers more benefits to me than any other credit card out there. I think that is the best way to go about this.I have never had to pay a balance transfer fee so it\u2019s not important to me.When choosing a credit card I always look at interest rates. The Momentum Visa has the lowest in Canada and with the balance transfer fee waived I save even more!I have been using my Momentum Visa since 2006 and have never paid a balance transfer fee.There\u2019s no better time to signup for your Scotiabank Momentum Visa and take advantage of their 0% balance transfer rate!I agree. I\u2019m all about low interest rates and perks, and the Scotiabank Momentum Visa is definitely the best option in that regard. What\u2019s your reason for choosing that credit card?Hey Scott! Great comment. I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re a big fan of the Scotiabank Momentum Visa. I\u2019m also a big fan. What\u2019s your reason for choosing this credit card?This poll needs some more options.I like the Scotiabank Momentum Visa. I\u2019m not sure I would call it the best of the best, but it\u2019s a very good choice for people who want cash back with the ability to use it anywhere in the world.Great poll idea! My favorite card so far has been the MBNA Platinum Plus MasterCard. It has a relatively low rate, great perks (free rental car insurance, etc.) and a pretty decent cashback program. I\u2019m also pretty good about paying off my credit card balances on time each month, so I don\u2019t need a card that has to offer me a low interest rate. I would say that the MBNA Platinum Plus MasterCard was the Best-Of-The-Best credit card.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. There's no shortage of options, but it comes down to preference and how much you value the perks on one card versus another.I use the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card, which has a $450 annual fee but reimburses me for $300 in travel expenses, including lodging. The 50% off Lyft rides and airport lounges is a huge plus, as well as the 3x points for travel purchases. With the exception of the annual fee, this card is a no-brainer for someone who likes to travel, especially internationally.Personally, I don't know anyone who's complained about how much they've saved on interest rates after switching to a new card. It really comes down to individual preferences and personal finance goals. Do you prefer the flexibility that a no-fee, 0% APR card offers? If so, then you can always pay off your debt before the intro rate expires.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. There is a new American Express card, called The Platinum Card\u00ae, that sounds quite impressive. It offers $450 in airline credits per year, a $200 Uber credit every year, and five points for every dollar you spend on flights and hotels (and one point for every other dollar you spend). There's even $100 credit towards your hotel stay, and $100 in Saks Fifth Avenue credits each year.I've done a lot of searching, but so far I haven't come up with another credit card that seems to offer such an impressive combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.Anyone familiar with other cards that compare?</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I have been using American Express's SimplyCash Card for Business since 2013, which is a flat-rate card that offers 5% back on all spending in its preferred categories (office supplies, cell phones, and cable and satellite) and 1% back on all other purchases. The card also has no annual fee and no introductory interest rate offers. The only drawback is that it's not a travel rewards card, which I would prefer. My business expenditures are generally not large enough to justify paying interest.A new option is Chase's Ink Plus Business Card, which offers 5% back on certain purchases (office supplies and cell phones), 2% back on gas and office supplies, and 1% back on all other purchases. The card also offers 2 points for every dollar spent, which can be redeemed for travel rewards. There is no annual fee or introductory interest rate offer.I'd be curious to know if you have any suggestions for an even better combination of perks, low interest rates, and financial flexibility. I'm not interested in paying an annual fee for the privilege of earning rewards, as I find that the annual fee is often higher than what I would earn.Ask an Expert: Which is the best business credit card?I would argue that the Chase Ink Plus Business card (link to chase.com) is the best business credit card you can find. The 5% back that you mention is true. But, the 5X rewards you earn is even better. It's 5x on travel and select business categories. It's 2X on gas and office supplies, and 1X on all other purchases.I would agree with your assessment that the American Express Business SimplyCash Card (link to amex.com) is also a good option. I would consider this one of the best options out there as long as you don't plan on using it much for travel.In order to take advantage of the 5% cash back bonus, you will have to purchase the card's required amount in the specified time period. This can be done in one large purchase, or you can simply buy it over time until you reach that threshold. The important thing to remember is that once you make that initial purchase, you don't have to spend any more money on the card in order to get 5% cash back!The American Express SimplyCash Business card also offers 5% cash back on some select categories, as well as 1% cash back on all other purchases. While there is no annual fee for this card, you should be aware that there is an introductory rate of 0% for the first 6 months. After that, the APR will be variable and could range from 15.24% to 24.24% depending on your creditworthiness.If you don't mind paying an annual fee, then I would recommend the Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card (link to chase.com). It offers 5% cash back on travel and dining purchases, as well as 3% cash back on drugstore and home improvement store purchases, and 1% cash back on all other purchases. There is no sign-up bonus for this card, but it does offer a 0% introductory APR for the first 12 months.Both the Chase Ink Plus Business card and the American Express SimplyCash Business card are great options for those who want to earn rewards on their business purchases.The Chase Ink Plus Business card offers a 5% cash back on office supply and cell phone purchases, 2% cash back on gas station and hotel/motel purchases, and 1% cash back on all other purchases. There is no annual fee for this card, but you will need to have good credit in order to qualify for the 5% cash back bonus.The American Express SimplyCash Business card offers a 5% cash back on all purchases made in the first 3 months from account opening, then 1% cash back on all other purchases made during the remainder of the year.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. The following cards were selected as the top five credit cards that offer the best of everything.The Chase Sapphire Preferred card comes with a $95 annual fee, but offers a sign up bonus of 50,000 points, which you can earn after spending $4,000 in the first three months of having the card. This sign up bonus is a huge value, and the 50,000 point sign up bonus is worth at least $625 if you redeem them on travel. The sign up bonus also comes with an additional 5,000 bonus points for each additional $1,000 you spend in the first three months. You get two points for every dollar you spend on travel and dining purchases, and one point for every dollar you spend on all other purchases.The Capital One VentureOne card comes with a $59 annual fee, but earns you 20,000 miles if you spend $3,000 in the first 3 months. This sign up bonus is worth at least $500 if you redeem the miles for travel. In addition, you earn two miles per dollar spent at hotels and rental cars, and one mile for every dollar you spend on other purchases. The card offers you an annual companion fare, which allows you to book a one-time round-trip flight for up to $300 for the primary cardholder.The Barclaycard Arrival Plus is a good rewards card, especially for the 2% points you earn for every dollar spent on travel and dining purchases. The card comes with a $89 annual fee, but you're offered a sign up bonus of 40,000 points, which is equal to $400 if you redeem the points for travel. In addition, the card offers a free first checked bag for each flight you book using the Barclaycard Arrival Plus card.The American Express Gold Delta card is a very versatile credit card, because you get 3x miles for every dollar spent on purchases made directly with Delta, 2x miles for every dollar spent at restaurants and hotels, and 1x miles for every dollar you spend on other purchases. The card comes with an annual fee of $195, but it offers a sign up bonus of 25,000 miles if you spend $1,000 in the first three months.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. You're unlikely to find a credit card that ticks all of these boxes, but I suspect that some of you may have managed to find something pretty decent. If you'd like to share the results of your research, feel free to jump into the comments below.Credit cards aren't all bad - they're a pretty useful financial tool as long as you can take advantage of them appropriately. When used responsibly, they can be a great way to rack up points and miles or to make purchases without paying for them all at once. Credit cards also make it a lot easier to build your credit score. So, when it comes to rewards, do you have a preference?I'm currently using the Barclays Arrival Plus World Elite MasterCard, which gives me an impressive 50,000 miles for spending $3,000 in three months. I haven't been happy with the lack of credit line increase, and Barclays is notoriously stingy about extending credit, but the sign-up bonus is just too good to pass up.The Chase Sapphire Preferred is another card that provides significant value for new cardholders, and you can get a $500 bonus for spending $4,000 in three months.Sometimes, though, it's better to focus on a no-frills option with a low interest rate and straightforward terms. In my opinion, the Citi Diamond Preferred is one of the best cards available for this purpose. The 21.49% APR is high by today's standards, but it's not hard to pay it off within a year if you're disciplined about your budget.Do you have a favorite credit card or are you willing to share your card rewards strategy?Happy 10th birthday to The Simple Dollar!I do have a favorite credit card and I\u2019ve written about it in a few other places. That would be the no annual fee Chase Freedom Unlimited card.This is the card that is the most flexible for me. I use this card for all of my day to day spending \u2013 grocery stores, gas, utilities, eating out, etc.I also have the Chase Freedom Unlimited in my wife\u2019s wallet and it is the card that she uses the most. She is also able to earn 1.5% back on the money she is spending.It is pretty rare to find a card that offers this flexibility and simplicity.For me, this card also has a very simple sign up bonus. All you have to do is spend $500 within 3 months of opening the card to receive the $150 sign up bonus. You can also earn a one time $200 referral bonus by having one of your friends apply with your referral code.Since this is the card that I use most often, I always keep an eye on the bonus categories. These are usually rotating and there is a different category each quarter.These categories are great for racking up some extra points in the year. Last year, I was able to earn 10,000 points in the first 3 months because I spent more on dining than normal and I was also able to earn 10,000 points because I spent a lot of money on Amazon in the fourth quarter.The Chase Freedom Unlimited is a no annual fee card and I have not had a single fee charged to my account since I\u2019ve been using it. There is no foreign transaction fee and there is also no minimum balance or minimum spending requirement.Beyond the bonus categories, Chase has also introduced something called \u201cQuickPay.\u201d This is a feature that you can enable in the app and this enables you to pay any Chase card, including the Freedom Unlimited, with Venmo and PayPal.This is one of the best credit cards that I\u2019ve ever had. It is very flexible and the rewards are good. If you\u2019re trying to build credit, I would recommend this card over others.That said, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever pay $150 for a sign up bonus. There are cards that have much higher bonuses and I\u2019d definitely give those cards a shot before jumping on this one.I really like the Citi Double Cash. I have the old version that earned 2% cashback, but the newer version earns 1%. I got it a few months ago after my 0% balance transfer deal ran out. I still have a few hundred dollars in balance transfer debt on the card, but I pay it off as quickly as I can, which helps me avoid paying interest.I use it for pretty much everything, except for travel and I don\u2019t have any other cards that have a travel rewards option. I like how easy the cashback is to use and I don\u2019t have to worry about bonus categories, minimum spending, etc.I also like the no annual fee and no balance transfer fees. I don\u2019t plan to keep it long term. I plan to pay off my balance in a few months, then close the account and move it to a different bank.I had the Barclays Arrival card and the no annual fee Chase Sapphire for a while, but I found that I wasn\u2019t getting very good rewards from the Chase Sapphire so I canceled it. I didn\u2019t like how the Chase Ultimate Rewards point system was set up. I wanted to use points to make travel reservations and it was always a hassle to make those reservations through Chase.I also had the Freedom Unlimited, but I cancelled that one because I wanted to get rid of one of my Chase cards (the no annual fee Freedom card).I think it\u2019s better to keep the Chase Sapphire Unlimited, even though it does have a fee, than to go with the no annual fee Freedom card. It has the sign up bonus and it has the 2% bonus on dining and travel, which is great.It also has no foreign transaction fees and I like the $0 fee on balance transfers, but the one negative thing is the 1.5% fee on all transactions. That can add up over the course of a year if you\u2019re not careful.The Barclays Arrival card is fine for getting a 50,000 mile sign up bonus, but I think the Chase Sapphire has a lot more value if you want to spend it on travel.For me, the best cashback credit card is the Citi Double Cash because it\u2019s easy to use, no annual fee, no foreign transaction fees and no interest charges. It\u2019s pretty easy to use and I always use it to make purchases because of the 2% cashback. I also have the Citi Double Cash at two different addresses and it\u2019s easy to manage.My second favorite cashback card is the Citi Simplicity card, which earns 1% cashback on everything. I don\u2019t use it as much because I don\u2019t spend a lot on it, but I also don\u2019t carry a balance.When I do use the Citi Simplicity card, I also like that it has no interest charges and no late fees, which makes it perfect for keeping my credit utilization low and for paying my balance off quickly to avoid paying interest.I like that I can set up autopay with my bank account to make payments automatic and it\u2019s also easy to set up with autopay. I don\u2019t use my Citi Simplicity card very often, but I use the Citi Double Cash card all the time. I use it to buy groceries and pay for everyday expenses. I don\u2019t need to do anything special to get rewards, I just make the purchases and I get the rewards. It\u2019s pretty simple and I like it a lot.The no annual fee Chase Freedom Unlimited card is the best cashback card I\u2019ve ever had. It earns 1.5% cashback on everything, but the most it can earn in one quarter is 2% cashback, which is great.I like that it earns cashback on all purchases and I can get the cashback in the form of a statement credit, a bank account transfer, a gift card, a check, or a direct deposit into my checking account. It\u2019s really easy to use and I just like the rewards that I get from it. I like that it has no foreign transaction fees and that there is no interest charged on purchases. I don\u2019t carry a balance on my Chase Freedom Unlimited card, so the interest fees don\u2019t really affect me, but I think it\u2019s nice that there aren\u2019t any interest charges.I also like that I don\u2019t have to worry about minimum spend requirements or bonus categories. I use my Chase Freedom Unlimited card to pay for all of my everyday expenses.I also like the new QuickPay feature that is on the app. I use it to pay my Chase card balance with Venmo or PayPal. I really like that it allows me to pay with a credit card, but I don\u2019t get charged a foreign transaction fee because I\u2019m using my U.S. dollar balance. I think that is a pretty neat feature.The Citi Double Cash card is really good, but it has a 1.5% annual fee, which can add up over the course of a year, but it\u2019s not really a problem for me because I\u2019m using it to pay for my everyday expenses. It also has a 2% cashback bonus when you make purchases at gas stations and supermarkets, which is really nice.The Citi Double Cash card is a pretty good card for me because I don\u2019t like having to spend a lot of money in order to get rewards. I also like that I can use it to pay for my everyday expenses and that I don\u2019t have to worry about minimum spend requirements or bonus categories.I have several credit cards and I like them all for different reasons.

I use my Freedom Unlimited card to make all of my everyday purchases and it has been a really good card for me.My Barclays Arrival Plus World Elite MasterCard is a pretty good card for me because I don\u2019t have to worry about minimum spend requirements or bonus categories. I just use it to make my purchases and I get the rewards.It\u2019s pretty easy to use and I just like that it has a 50,000 mile sign up bonus, which is great.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. You have a number of options, so let's look at some of your options.Chase Sapphire Preferred. For starters, you earn 2x points on travel and dining purchases, 1x point on everything else. You get a 20,000 point bonus if you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months. Points are worth 25 cents each and there is a $95 annual fee.Ink Plus. With the Ink Plus, you earn 5x points for office supply purchases, 2x points for gas purchases, and 1x points on everything else. The Ink Plus also offers $0 balance transfer fees for 12 months and it is one of the few cards that doesn't charge foreign transaction fees. You'll receive a $95 annual fee, but no sign-up bonus.Chase Freedom. With the Freedom, you earn 1% back on purchases and 5% back on rotating categories. This makes it one of the best cards for earning extra cash back on dining and gas purchases. There is a $95 annual fee, but you receive a $100 bonus after you spend $500 in the first 3 months.American Express\u00ae Premier Rewards Gold Card. The Premier Rewards Gold earns 2x points at gas stations and restaurants, 1x point on everything else. You get a $100 statement credit if you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months. Points are worth 25 cents each and there is a $175 annual fee.Citi PremierPass. The Citi PremierPass earns 2x points on travel and gas purchases, and 1x point on everything else. There is a $75 annual fee.I have used and currently use the Chase Ink.I love that the signup bonus is the same as everyone elses, and that it doesn't expire.The ability to transfer points to airlines is a huge plus. The travel website is easy to use. I usually get 40k plus a signup bonus per year on a $500 purchase.I use my Citi ThankYou Premier for everything I can. For example, I used it to book an airline ticket for 10,000 ThankYou points. It was the only way to use a Citi credit card to book an airline ticket online.I currently have the Amex Premier Rewards Gold Card (I think I'm on my fourth or fifth card from that series). For my purposes, it offers the best rewards, as I don't mind paying a bit extra in interest to not have to track and redeem points, and I travel enough to meet the $1000 spending requirement every year. It also has the most useful \"extra features\" of the cards I'm considering. I like that I can have travel and emergency evacuation insurance, a few different kinds of rental car insurance, and no foreign transaction fees. The ability to pay using the card in most foreign countries is nice too (I know that my Discover card will charge me a 3% surcharge for using it in Canada, and there is no fee for using the Amex). I also like the \"Pay With Points\" feature - I've been trying to find a reason to use it on something expensive like an Apple product (iPad or Apple Watch), but I have yet to find the right opportunity.I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred card. I have earned a ton of free flights and hotel stays for my family and I.My main interest in credit cards is to earn free travel. I currently have the Citi Premierpass card which earns 2 points for every dollar spent. That means a $3,000 spend this year should result in a $1,200 travel credit. I have never spent more than $500 in a year so this card works great for me. I also have the Chase Sapphire Preferred which is another great card as it is tied to the Chase Freedom card which gives me a lot of spending flexibility. I use the Chase Sapphire card for international travel where I get the points and the Chase Freedom for domestic purchases where I get the cash back.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. The one that came to mind was Chase Freedom Unlimited, but my colleague Eric Rosen is here to dispute that. Read on to see which credit card he thinks is the best in 2019, and to see what other cards are worth considering, including my personal pick for best travel credit card.Eric Rosen: As a person who's interested in paying as little interest as possible on debt, and who wants a travel credit card to have the ability to book travel through, I choose Capital One Quicksilver.That's a lot of value. And while the $150 statement credit isn't available for all travel purchases, it's a decent deal if you know what to book.And while the $500 cash back is a one-time deal, you can earn 5% back on travel, 3% back on dining, and 1.5% back on everything else. That's one of the highest caps in any card with no annual fee.A $200 cash-back bonus after spending $1,000 on the card in the first three months would also make me a believer in the Capital One Quicksilver card.The main thing the Quicksilver lacks is 0% interest offers. But for those with a budget in order, this could be a good fit.Kelsey Sheehy: I agree that it's a good deal if you know where to spend. That said, it might not be as generous as you think.For one, the bonus only applies to new cardholders. If you've ever had a Quicksilver card, you're not eligible. And to get the 5% bonus on travel, 3% on dining, and 1.5% on everything else, you need to book through Capital One's online portal, and spend at least $5,000 a year with them. And they only offer 1.25% back if you don't hit that $5,000 mark.For a no annual fee card, the Quicksilver is a good choice if you book a lot of travel with Capital One and you know you'll hit the minimum spend. But you have better options for cash back if you don't mind paying an annual fee.The Capital One Savor card is a great alternative. It offers 4% cash back at dining and entertainment, 2% back at grocery stores, and 1% back on everything else. But unlike the Quicksilver, it has a $95 annual fee.Kelsey Sheehy: You're not wrong. But you need to be comfortable with not getting any of those perks if you can't hit the minimum spend.Eric Rosen: I don't care about those, or about the perks at all.Kelsey Sheehy: Fair enough. There are a lot of good no annual fee cards to choose from. If you want to dodge the annual fee, I think you're better off with the Citi Double Cash card. It offers 1% back when you buy, and 1% back when you pay it off. There's no minimum spend, and you get an introductory 0% interest offer.I also think the Citi ThankYou Premier card is a great option. It offers 3 points per dollar on dining and travel, 2 points per dollar on other purchases, and no annual fee.That said, I'm a big believer in the Chase Sapphire Preferred. It offers 2x points on travel and dining, and a $500 annual travel credit.Plus, it comes with a 0% interest offer for the first 15 months. That means if you book a big purchase like a vacation, you'll have some time to pay it off and avoid interest.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.I'm a huge fan of the Chase Sapphire Reserve card and have found it to be the best choice for my own financial needs.But I'm not sure that the Reserve is a good fit for everyone. It's $450 annual fee is a non-starter for some people.I'd like to learn which credit card(s) are the best option for you.Please let me know what your choice is and why you think the card is best for you in the comment section.Personally, I'm a big fan of the Chase Sapphire Reserve card. It's the card I've used for years and is my top choice right now.It's main draw is the travel rewards that are offered. But I've found it's an extremely flexible credit card. I can use it to buy just about anything I want and then pay for it over time without paying any interest. That's a huge advantage over using a debit card or cash.Plus, I can use my points to book travel for a friend or family member and not have to worry about having enough points to cover the entire cost.That's why I'm asking: Which credit card offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility?I'm a big fan of the Chase Sapphire Reserve. I travel often and value the travel perks the card offers. Plus, I know I can use it for anything I need.Personally, I'd say that the Chase Sapphire Reserve is my number one card for traveling.

The 5X points on dining and travel can be great, but the $450 annual fee is too much for me.It's too expensive for me to use the card for everyday purchases. I'm more of a \"set it and forget it\" type of person, so I wouldn't use the card to pay for my day to day expenses.I would rather use a card like the Chase Freedom Unlimited, which is a more basic credit card. It has no annual fee and offers the same rewards as the Chase Sapphire Reserve.Chase Sapphire Preferred: 5X points on travel & dining (up to $1,500 spend per month)Chase Sapphire Reserve: 5X points on travel & dining (no limit)Chase Freedom Unlimited: 1.5% cash back (no cap)Chase Freedom Unlimited: No annual feeIt's a tough choice.

It's been a great choice for me, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good credit card for everyday spending.There are a lot of credit cards out there, but there's no better combination of rewards and benefits than the Chase Sapphire Reserve.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. I'm wondering what you use for your credit card now, and if you have plans to apply for any different cards in the near future.Most people use credit cards for convenience, rewards, and even for their low interest rates. Credit cards, when used appropriately, can be a powerful tool to help build and repair credit scores. In fact, a majority of credit scores are heavily influenced by your payment history.Paying your bill on time each month helps increase your FICO scores, and the higher your FICO score the better your overall credit health. As a matter of fact, a majority of the population would be hard-pressed to get a decent mortgage rate or even a decent interest rate on a personal loan if they had low credit scores. That's why it's important that you understand what's best for you.My wife and I recently applied for and were denied a home equity loan because our FICO scores weren't high enough. It was very disappointing and a real setback because we needed to remodel the basement of our home. We had a couple of options, such as taking a personal loan, but the interest rate would have been exorbitant. Fortunately, I was able to get my FICO score back up to 800. That's good enough to get us a low interest rate on the home equity loan.Credit cards come in all shapes and sizes. And, as such, they offer a wide range of benefits and perks. Credit cards have become an essential part of life in the United States. The convenience, rewards and the low interest rates have caused most people to use credit cards almost exclusively when making purchases.Credit cards have come a long way since their inception over 50 years ago. Nowadays, credit cards are more commonly used by those with low credit scores to help them increase their creditworthiness. In fact, it's not uncommon for people to have scores in the low to mid 600 range, but have credit cards with limit of $15,000 or higher. These cards have helped these consumers build and repair their credit scores.There are many credit card choices for consumers to choose from. But which one is best for you? This is a hard question to answer because of the many features, benefits, and rates associated with credit cards. Each person's financial situation is different. One credit card might be better for someone with a good credit score, while another might be more beneficial for someone with a bad credit score.There are also some credit cards that come with annual fees and other fees, so it's important to weigh the pros and cons of each credit card to make sure it's right for you.Which credit card is the best for your needs? In my opinion, it's all about how much money you make and how often you use it.I know a lot of people who use credit cards to make large purchases and then pay off the balance at the end of the month. However, this isn't always a good idea. There are a few things that you need to consider before using a credit card, such as interest rates, rewards programs, and whether or not it's worth it for you to have the card in the first place.If you want a credit card that has a high rewards program and low interest rate, then you might want to look at Capital One's Venture card. If you want a credit card that gives you cash back on every purchase, then you might want to look at Discover's Cashback Bonus card. If you want a credit card that gives you a lot of flexibility and isn't as expensive as other options, then you might want to look at Amex's Blue Cash Preferred card.I'm not going to make this article too long. In short, I think that the Capital One Venture card is the best credit card for most people. It's got a low annual fee, it has an awesome rewards program, and the interest rate is low compared to other cards.There are two types of people in this world: those who use credit cards and those who don't. For those who don't, they often have a hard time getting a good interest rate on a credit card and are forced to pay cash for most things they purchase.If you're a person who uses credit cards, then you know that there are a ton of great options out there. There are rewards cards, low-interest cards, and even no-annual-fee cards that can help you save money and build credit. But with so many options, it's hard to know which one is best for you.The best credit card for me is the Capital One Venture card. I have been a loyal Capital One customer for years and have never had any issues with them. The Venture card gives me an annual fee of $59, and I can get 2 miles per dollar spent on all purchases (except for airfare and car rentals). I can also transfer my miles to other airlines or hotels if I want to redeem them for a trip.I have a Venture card. I've had it for about a year now, and it's worked great for me. I love the rewards program, and I use it for everything I can. I also love that I can use my points to book flights and hotels, so it's a really versatile card.The only downside is that there's a $59 annual fee, but that's pretty standard for a travel rewards card.</s>",

If you have an American Express, then you probably already know what to expect from the company. They've always been known to provide some of the most impressive perks and benefits to customers who have an account with the company. However, there are several other credit card companies that are very similar.When you're considering a credit card, you probably won't know a lot about the company that provides the credit card.

The truth is that the company that provides a credit card can have a big impact on the amount of money that you'll pay in interest and fees each month.When you sign up for a new credit card, you'll have to decide on the terms that are associated with the card. There are certain things that you'll need to know about the company that is providing the credit card before you sign up for one. You need to find out how much the company will charge you each month, how much the interest rate is, and how long the term is.

I think that's why they made that change.I don't think we've tried any others yet.I agree about the Chase Freedom card. I've never had a rewards card before, so it's all new to me. It's nice to know what I've been buying over the last couple months. The gas is definitely the most useful so far. I also like that I get rewards even when my balance is zero, instead of just paying a fee.I've been thinking of getting the Chase Freedom card for a long time now. I think I've heard lots of good things about it. And I do enjoy cash back rewards.I've been a cash back rewards card user for years, but never have used the Chase Freedom. It does sound like a good deal.Cash back cards are always a good thing for me. I am on the lookout for a cash back card that offers travel rewards.I do have a Chase Sapphire Preferred Card but the annual fee is a bit too high. I'd rather have a card without an annual fee or at least with a smaller annual fee.I'm still waiting for the day when the \"annual fee\" isn't charged annually!I use both of those credit cards but don't use them much for cashback. I use mine to pay for a few other things that aren't covered under my other insurance. The only thing I dislike about the Chase Freedom card is the time it takes to redeem the cashback. I would like to see them speed it up a little bit.</s>",

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.And by flexibility I mean something like the ability to get access to cash at ATM's, to get an overdraft line of credit, and to get a balance transfer.What about the ability to get a low interest rate that would make it easier to pay off your debt?I'd be curious to know which card you like and why.Re: What is your favorite credit card?I use a combination of my Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (for cash back) and my American Express Everyday Preferred (for cash back on groceries, gas, drug stores and department stores).I don't know about flexibility, but I like the rewards. For me, the best combination is American Express Blue Cash Everyday card. This card earns 3% back at US supermarkets, 2% back at US gas stations, and 1% back at US department stores and 1% back everywhere else. No annual fee and you get $100 cash back after you spend $1,000 in the first 6 months.I like the Blue Cash Everyday card. I think the American Express Delta is a better card for me, but I can't get one. I also really like the Discover it.I like Chase Freedom Unlimited for flexibility. I like Citi Double Cash and Citi Premier because of their rewards and no annual fee. I like the Discover it and I think the Citi Double Cash is better than it. I like Amex Everyday for its ease of use and no annual fee. I like the Fidelity Investment Rewards Amex for the 2% rewards on travel and gas, no foreign transaction fees, and the chance to get a statement credit for TSA Precheck. The only thing I don't like about Amex is their lack of ATMs and lack of gas stations in their network. But there's not much you can do. You just have to find a gas station that accepts Amex. You have to be really careful if you are going to buy something with your Amex. You can use the Blue Cash card anywhere. The Chase Freedom Unlimited is a good no-annual-fee rewards card. The only reason I don't use it is because I've got so many Chase cards. I would say Amex Everyday is good. It's better than other cards because you don't have to worry about a foreign transaction fee, and you can use it anywhere. It's also a no-fee card. I also like the Fidelity Investment Rewards Amex. It's the only card I have where I don't get charged a foreign transaction fee. It has a low APR, and it's a no-fee card.I like the Slate card. It doesn't have a fee, so it's good if you want to avoid that. I like the Chase Freedom Unlimited for it's ease of use and the rewards are good. I don't like the Discover It because I don't like the way the rewards are calculated. The Amex Everyday is the best card for me because of the cash back. I like it because I can use it at grocery stores, gas stations, drug stores, and department stores. I don't like it because it has a high APR. I also don't like the Discover It because I don't like the way the rewards are calculated. The Chase Freedom Unlimited is a good no-fee card. The Amex Everyday is a good no-fee card. I like it because I can use it at grocery stores, gas stations, drug stores, and department stores. I don't like it because it has a high APR. The Fidelity Investment Rewards Amex is a good no-fee card. I like it because I don't have to pay a foreign transaction fee.

We also know that if we keep our balance low, we won't owe much interest.

I currently own an AMEX Gold card and a Chase Freedom Unlimited card, and I'm wondering if I should keep both or if there's a better alternative.I've had the Chase Freedom Unlimited for more than a year, and I'm generally satisfied with its 1.5% cash back rate on most purchases, but I'm not sure I like that it has no annual fee. My current AMEX Gold card is a little more complicated, but I get a $100 annual fee credit, plus 3% cash back on dining, 2% on US supermarkets, 1% on all other purchases, and an APR of 13.24%.It's hard to know what other benefits there might be, but I'm curious to see which card readers believe offers a better deal.RE: Any recommendations on a credit card?If I were to recommend one credit card it would be the Capital One Venture card, but only because of the 50,000 miles bonus you can get by signing up with a 50,000 miles bonus.I also would recommend the United Explorer card (not for its benefits but for the free companion pass), which is the only reason I still have that card. If you aren't a United flyer, I would suggest getting the Chase Sapphire card, as they are very useful for any traveler.The Chase Sapphire Reserve is another good card, but it has an annual fee of $550.I would also recommend the Amazon Visa card, which has a $0 annual fee and a 3% cash back rate on Amazon purchases.I have the Citi Hilton HHonors American Express card and like it, but it has an annual fee.Lastly, I would recommend the Chase Freedom card, as they are generally a great card that I use for all my grocery shopping and eating out.I'm curious to see which card readers believe offers a better deal.The Capital One Venture card is the best card to own, as it has no annual fee, and you can get a 50,000 mile bonus when you sign up for a new card.If you are a United flyer, I would recommend the United Explorer card, as you will get a free companion pass, which is great for traveling to multiple locations.If you aren't a United flyer, I would recommend the Chase Sapphire card, as they are great for traveling to multiple locations.The Chase Sapphire Reserve is another good card, but it has an annual fee of $550, which may be worth the annual fee, depending on your travel habits.I would also recommend the Amazon Visa card, which has a $0 annual fee and a 3% cash back rate on Amazon purchases.I have the Citi Hilton HHonors American Express card, and I like it, but it has an annual fee of $95.I have the AMEX Gold card, and it is great for traveling, but the annual fee is $150.I have the Citi Hilton HHonors card, and I like it, but the annual fee is $75.I have the AMEX Platinum card, and it is great for traveling, but the annual fee is $550.I have the Citi Hilton HHonors card, and I like it, but the annual fee is $95.I have the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, and it is great for traveling, but the annual fee is $450.I have the Amazon Visa card, and it is great for traveling, but the annual fee is $0.I have the AMEX Platinum card, and it is great for traveling, but the annual fee is $550.I have the Chase Freedom card, and it is great for traveling, but the annual fee is $0.I have the AMEX Platinum card, and it is great for traveling, but the annual fee is $0.I have the Citi Hilton HHonors card, and I like it, but the annual fee is $0.I have the Capital One Venture card, and it is great for traveling, but the annual fee is $0.I have the Capital One Venture card, and I like it, but the annual fee is $0.I have the Capital One Venture card, and it is great for traveling, but the annual fee is $0.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. What card(s) do you recommend?I\u2019ve been a member of both AMEX and Citi\u2019s Dividend Card programs. I\u2019ve received some nice perks and discounts, but have never had much luck getting any of the really great rewards that others have shared in these forums. I was wondering what type of points/cash back rewards programs other folks participate in.How much rewards do you earn on a regular basis?How do you redeem your rewards?Does anyone know of an airline or hotel reward program that provides a lot of rewards for the amount of money spent?I currently receive about $120 in rewards per year through the Citi card. I redeem them through Citi as a statement credit, or to offset the cost of my credit card balance.For air travel I participate in United's mileage program (I love to travel, and I am a frequent United flyer). My primary use is to travel internationally to visit family (especially for trips that include a significant distance such as China, Canada, and Germany). I also get a nice bonus on domestic travel. I've been able to use the miles to get upgrades on certain flights. However, this usually only occurs during peak travel seasons (holidays, summer vacations, etc.).For accommodations I use Hilton HHonors, Marriott, and Hyatt. I\u2019ve used my rewards to stay in luxury hotels in Hawaii, Europe, and California. My rewards have paid for all or part of hotel stays at The Conrad, The Westin, The Hyatt, The Marriott, the Waldorf-Astoria, the Intercontinental, and the Four Seasons.I've found this to be a great perk of these programs.It is my understanding that these programs are very good if your travel is international in nature, but not so useful if you are traveling domestically. If you find yourself in an area of the country with limited air service, you\u2019re probably going to find these programs to be a bit of a pain.</s>",
        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. It's definitely not a fair question. There is no \"best credit card,\" and the best choice for you is different from the best choice for someone else.But if we are talking about a few particular cards that are really good, the two that stand out are the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae and Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card.The Sapphire Reserve has long been praised by travel rewards experts. It has the highest annual fee of any of the premium credit cards currently available: $450 per year. But it is jam-packed with perks, such as a $300 annual travel credit, Priority Pass airport lounge membership, and a 50% rebate on TSA Precheck/Global Entry application fees.The $450 annual fee of the Sapphire Reserve is certainly a stumbling block for some, and the card's benefits may not be as valuable to some as to others. For example, the $300 annual travel credit may not be useful to those who do not travel much or prefer to rent a car instead of use ride-share services. If you travel at least three or four times a year, then you can probably take advantage of all the benefits of the Sapphire Reserve. The $300 credit, Priority Pass membership, TSA Precheck credit, $100 Global Entry credit, $100 Global Entry or TSA Precheck application fee credit, and 10x bonus points on Lyft and Uber rides should cover most people's travel-related expenses.You also get the Chase Sapphire Reserve's 50% rebate for Global Entry and TSA Precheck every four years when you pay the application fee. You can also earn 10x points on Lyft and Uber rides. Those who use these services for most or all of their travel needs could easily save a few hundred dollars a year with this benefit.But let's face it: The Sapphire Reserve's biggest benefit is the value of its 50% bonus points on all travel purchases. You get 50% back on every dollar you spend on travel, which you can redeem at 1.5 cents apiece as statement credits, cash, or transfer to frequent flyer miles. It's a very good deal. But it is not a no-cost benefit: Your rewards are worth $750 if you redeem for statement credits or cash, or $375 if you transfer to frequent flyer miles.You get a 50% bonus on points earned from groceries, gas stations, and restaurants, too. But those benefits are available only if you have the Chase Sapphire Preferred card and don't have the Sapphire Reserve card. In that case, you can earn a 10x bonus on your purchases. That's the main reason to get the Preferred card: its $95 annual fee.It's worth noting that the Chase Sapphire Preferred card offers the same 50% bonus points on all travel purchases as the Sapphire Reserve. This benefit does not require the Preferred card to be paid every year. You can still get it if you pay the Sapphire Reserve's $450 annual fee and cancel after the first year.The Sapphire Preferred card does not offer the Sapphire Reserve's 50% rebate for Global Entry and TSA Precheck. But it does have the same 10x points on Lyft and Uber rides, and you also get 2x points on dining and groceries (with a $1,000 quarterly limit).Which card is right for you depends on whether you think the $450 annual fee of the Sapphire Reserve is worth it. And it depends on whether you need or want the benefits of the Sapphire Reserve's 50% bonus on travel purchases.If you travel at least three times a year, the Sapphire Reserve is probably worth it. But if you don't travel very much, then you should consider the Sapphire Preferred. The Sapphire Preferred is a good card to use if you like to dine out or grocery shop regularly. The card's 2x points on these categories are worth 4% cash back, which beats the 3% cash back on dining and travel offered by the Sapphire Reserve. The Sapphire Reserve's 50% bonus is worth only 2% in the form of cash back.The Sapphire Reserve's 50% bonus is not worth 2%. It's worth much more than that.You can use the Sapphire Reserve's 50% bonus for any travel expenses you would incur, such as flights, hotels, car rentals, and food and drinks on the road. You can also use the bonus to pay your credit card bill. But there are many other uses as well.You can get the Chase Sapphire Reserve if you want to pay the $450 annual fee. But you can get the Sapphire Preferred if you don't need to spend more than $95.The best credit card for travel rewards depends on how you use it.What to do with your Chase Sapphire Reserve points?The Chase Sapphire Reserve card is a good choice for travelers who are interested in earning a lot of points for their spending.In the last couple of months, I've had the opportunity to use the card for travel to New York City, Boston, and Chicago. I was able to book my flights through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal, and I used the card to cover my hotel stay and food expenses during my trip.I've also been able to use my points for other things like airline miles and merchandise. I've used the points for a couple of gifts, and I've been able to redeem the points for gift cards.In my opinion, the Chase Sapphire Reserve is one of the best travel rewards cards on the market today.What is the best credit card for business travel?The best credit card for business travel is one that gives you the most miles and points for the money you spend.There are a lot of good credit cards for business travel.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.A lot of the time the credit cards people mention are Visa and Mastercard, which is perfectly fine since those are very popular and easy to find.However, there are a lot of lesser known cards that I'd like to know about.In the past year alone, I've become a member of the Citi Prestige and the American Express Platinum card.

Any other suggestions?Sounds like you might be in the market for a new credit card, and I can certainly see why: With all the new perks that credit cards offer, it's hard not to be tempted.I asked the Buzz community which credit card is the best -- and boy, was I surprised by some of their answers. Here's how they ranked the top four cards and what they had to say about them.As you can see, these credit cards were ranked very close together.A big reason for the credit cards' close proximity in our poll is probably the fact that the cards are designed to suit different kinds of travelers. For example, the Capital One Venture Rewards Card offers some of the best perks for people who prefer to stay in hotels while the Chase Sapphire Preferred card is geared toward those who enjoy traveling with less planning and more spontaneity.However, our survey results show that both the Capital One Venture Rewards Card and the Chase Sapphire Preferred card were popular with the community, and we also saw a strong following for the Bank of America Travel Rewards Card and the Barclays Arrival Plus Card.In the end, the top two credit cards were really up to you and the type of traveler you are. With that said, below are some common themes that we saw in people's comments about each of these credit cards.\"I like this card because there are no blackout dates or rewards restrictions. You can redeem your points for cash, gift cards or travel.\"\"You can use the credit card anywhere in the world and it will be accepted as cash, plus, you get double rewards on every purchase. This is great for frequent travelers!\"\"You can book almost any kind of travel using your points, which is very cool.\"\"I think this card is great if you are planning on traveling often, especially if you want to stay in hotels because you can use your points for free travel and hotel accommodations.\"\"I've used it for the past two years and haven't had any problems at all. It's great because you can use the points you earn at any time to pay for travel expenses.\"\"This is my favorite credit card to use because you can get 1.5 miles for every dollar you spend.\"\"This card is ideal for anyone who travels because you can earn points on everything from airline tickets and hotels to car rentals.\"\"I like this card because it's pretty easy to get the signup bonus and it gives me enough points to travel for a weekend.\"\"I think this card is a good choice for anyone who wants to earn rewards that they can use for travel, especially if you have a business that you travel for.\"As you can see, there are a lot of things to love about each of these cards, and it's really hard to pick just one.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility. You know the card I'm talking about: The best of the best.Sometimes, one card might seem to fit the bill, but then you learn there's a higher APR on a purchase (for instance). Another card might seem ideal at first glance, but then you realize the benefits don't last as long as you'd hoped.I have a number of different cards in my wallet. I'm a credit card churner, and like to see what's out there. Some of my favorites? The USAA Rewards Checking card and the Chase Sapphire Preferred, both of which offer great rewards, low rates, and little-to-no annual fees. I've also got my Citi Hilton HHonors card, which has been great for me.While I like to have a variety of cards in my wallet, it's certainly not ideal to carry around several cards just for the sake of it. My friend Jill over at Jill Cataldo's Money Smart Blog does this, and I know a few other folks who do the same. I think it's safe to say that I'm in the minority here, though.But what if you're looking for one card that does everything? One card that's ideal for a variety of situations?With so many different credit cards out there, it's tough to choose just one. But if you look at the Citi Double Cash card, there are several reasons to give it a second look.This is one of the few cards I've come across that offers 1% cash back on everything you buy. And, of course, there's a second 1% cash back reward on everything you buy, so it's 2% in total. It's a simple, uncomplicated deal.Plus, there's a 0% introductory APR on balance transfers and purchases for 18 months. That's a nice deal if you're trying to get out of debt and consolidate your balance.I think the best part about this card is the fact that you don't have to worry about annual fees. There are no fees, no rewards expiration, and no need to worry about making minimum payments every month.And while I don't recommend using credit cards for things like buying plane tickets, that's what this card is great for. If you want to buy a plane ticket using the card, you'll pay no extra fees.I think it's safe to say that the Citi Double Cash Card isn't for everyone. But if you're looking for a solid credit card that offers perks, flexibility, and ease of use, this is one you'll want to consider.For more information on the Citi Double Cash card, check out the offer.Do you have one credit card that's ideal for everything?

Review your credit card statements for the past six months.2. List out the types of purchases you're making and how much money you're spending in each category.3. Add up the total amount of money you're spending in each category.4. Compare this total to the total amount of money you're making from your income sources (e.g., salary, freelance work, investments).5. If you're spending more than you're earning, then you should probably consider consolidating your debt into a lower-interest loan or getting help from a credit counselor to set up a budget and get out of debt.6. If you're spending less than you're earning, then you might want to consider opening a savings account or getting a student loan or home equity loan.Once you've figured out your spending habits, you can use this information to choose the right credit card for you.

        "<s> I'm curious to know which credit card you believe offers the best combination of perks, low interest rates, and overall financial flexibility.Several of my friends and family members are loyal to particular credit card brands. They might prefer Visa or Mastercard because they believe the rewards programs are the best or because they believe one card has a better record of approving purchases. For my part, I'm interested in a flexible, widely accepted credit card with excellent customer service and an excellent rewards program. I want a credit card that also gives me some control over my interest rates and fees.In order to get a better sense of which credit cards are out there, I took a look at the American Express Blue Cash Preferred Card, Chase Freedom card, Citi Custom Cash, and the Discover it card. These four cards are among the most commonly recommended cards in personal finance circles.Amex offers a very simple rewards program, which is an advantage for those who don't like too much complexity in their lives. On top of that, the Blue Cash Preferred card offers great rewards rates if you're looking to earn extra cash back on groceries, gas, and travel expenses. The downside is that you will be subject to a 3 percent cash-back penalty for all purchases that fall outside of those categories. You'll also have to pay an annual fee to use this card.This card doesn't have a rewards program, but it does offer a great deal for customers who are loyal to the company's brand. Cardholders get 5 percent cash back in rotating bonus categories and 1 percent cash back on everything else. The categories are chosen each quarter. In addition to that, Chase Freedom cardholders get 5 percent cash back on travel and drugstore purchases.Those are two excellent perks, but they come at a price. You'll have to pay an annual fee, and the card carries a standard variable APR of 16.99 percent to 24.99 percent. Cardholders also have a credit limit of $500, and this card requires excellent credit.On the surface, this seems like a great deal. Cardholders can earn 5 percent cash back on grocery store purchases, 5 percent cash back at gas stations and 3 percent cash back on other purchases. However, the rewards program comes with a few limitations. Citi Custom Cash cardholders have to spend at least $500 within the first three months of opening an account in order to earn the 5 percent reward. In addition to that, cash back expires after a year unless you use your Citi Custom Cash rewards on an eligible purchase.This isn't a big deal if you spend at least $500 every three months on the card, but it can make this card less attractive if you're not spending at least $1,500 every year.This card's greatest benefit is the 5 percent cash back reward on rotating categories. If you are able to spend $1,500 or more on the card every year, you'll earn 5 percent cash back on all of your purchases.You can also earn 5 percent cash back on travel and drugstore purchases. However, if you don't spend at least $1,500 each year, you won't earn the 5 percent cash back rewards. You'll also have to spend $500 on the Discover card within three months of opening an account.The good news is that Discover has no annual fees and a very low interest rate of 11.99 percent to 24.99 percent. However, your credit score will play a major role in determining whether you're approved for this card.Which Credit Card Offers the Best Deal?As you can see, each of these cards has its own strengths.For those who aren't concerned about rewards programs, Chase Freedom cardholders may have the best deal out there. The card has no annual fee, and the APR is on the low side for a card that isn't a rewards card. On the other hand, those who want to earn some cash back on their purchases will probably prefer the Blue Cash Preferred card.For those who prefer a credit card with excellent rewards programs, the Citi Custom Cash card might be the best option. Cardholders can earn up to 5 percent cash back on their purchases, but they have to make sure they spend at least $500 on the card within the first three months and $1,500 each year.I think the Discover it card may be the best deal out there. In addition to offering cash back rewards, this card carries a low variable APR of 11.99 percent to 24.99 percent.The key to deciding which credit card is the best is figuring out which card offers the most perks to your specific situation.</s>"
