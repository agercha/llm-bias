My laptop came with Win 10 Pro, but I hate Windows. When I try to boot with UEFI it starts but stops with a message that there is a conflict with the BIOS firmware. When I try to boot without UEFI, the BIOS menu does not appear, it stays black. Do I need to change the BIOS? How? Thank you.\nI don't think you should do anything in the BIOS. You can try to change to UEFI mode, you can remove the old firmware, you can change it to the new one, but that is risky. You can use an USB disk to try to do it, but be very careful, do some research first.\nIf you can't do it, just use Linux and forget about Windows.\nHi, thanks for replying. I did a factory reset and tried to boot again. It stops after the HP logo and it shows a message that there is a conflict with the BIOS firmware. I have also tried to change UEFI to Legacy mode, but the same. I also have a USB 2.0 port and USB 3.0. It says on the UEFI bios screen that I need to install the latest UEFI driver. I tried to find the UEFI driver but it is not in the laptop.\nSorry, I misunderstood what you said. I thought you said you can boot the PC but you can't get to the BIOS, is that right? Anyway, what does \"there is a conflict with the BIOS firmware\" mean? Can you tell us more about what it says? Are you sure you know how to get into BIOS mode?\nYou could try booting into a Linux live disk and editing the GRUB boot configuration.</s>",

While I agree that each user has their own preferences, I think it's crucial to analyze the key attributes of various operating systems, including performance, user interface, and compatibility with software. In this article, I'll share my insights on how each of these factors play a role in choosing the best operating system for your needs.\nFirstly, let's talk about performance. I believe that performance is a crucial aspect when it comes to selecting an operating system. With the increase in usage of heavy applications, it's imperative to have an operating system that can handle the load. However, performance can be a subjective term as it varies from person to person. Some people might not require high-performance applications, while others might require a system that can handle multiple applications at the same time.\nNow, let's move on to user interface. This is a personal preference and it varies from individual to individual. Some people prefer a minimalistic interface, while others like a highly customizable interface. Some operating systems might have a cluttered interface, while others might have a clean and easy to navigate interface. Some people like a traditional interface, while others like a touch interface. Ultimately, it's the user's preference on how they want to interact with their operating system.\nFinally, compatibility with software. This is another important factor to consider. It's crucial to check whether the operating system you're considering supports the software you're planning to use. Some operating systems might not have a wide range of applications, while others might have a vast range of applications. Some applications might be better suited for certain operating systems, while others might be more compatible with other operating systems.\nIn summary, the best operating system for you is the one that meets your requirements in terms of performance, user interface, and compatibility with software. As a tech enthusiast, I believe that performance, user interface, and compatibility are the key factors to consider when selecting an operating system.</s>",
