        "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate denim brand that excels in providing comfortable and on-trend denim, with additional features such as a diverse range of fits, sustainable practices, and suitable for various occasions?\nP.S. We are based in Canada and prefer local brands. Thanks!\n@margie\nDifferent jean brands are popular for different reasons. As such, this is a highly subjective matter!\nMy personal favourite brand is REDWING (USA). They have a very limited selection and only do Made in USA denim (not 100% made in USA, but mostly). They only have a single fit for both men and women and they don't have any denim with stretch. However, their jeans are incredibly comfortable. The reason for this is that they have an unlined denim (so no lining, no lining in pockets, no sewn pocket bags, and no button fly). This allows them to use a softer fabric that feels like cashmere and is quite lightweight. They also use non-standard thread, which is a cotton-based thread that is softer and more flexible (and does not shrink).\nUnlike most other brands, REDWING has a very small selection of fabrics. There are only three styles: Rough and Tough (which is a very sturdy denim, perfect for tough jobs), 19 Mile (a very lightweight denim that's good for a casual look), and 875 (a dark, very hard denim). I recommend the 19 Mile. It's super lightweight and flexible, has a great drape, and still has enough structure to last a while. The Rough and Tough is also good for a tough look, but the 875 is pretty much only for tough jobs.\nMy favourite style from REDWING is the 355. They have a classic straight fit and a short, classic length. It's the most versatile fit in my opinion. The style is not as flattering as some of the other cuts, but it's by far the most comfortable.\nIf you want something that is more fashion forward, then maybe you should look into RRL (also USA). It's a brand that started in the 1960s and is now owned by Ralph Lauren. It's very fashion forward, but the brand is relatively new. They only have a handful of styles and the cuts are all similar. I think that they are a bit more fashion-forward, but their jeans aren't quite as comfortable.\nThe brand that I recommend most to people in the US is 1921 (USA). They have a wide selection of jeans, and their style is very fashion-forward, but they're also very comfortable. Their jeans are very durable and have a great fit. They have a lot of variety in their cuts, and they do a lot of stretch denim. I would definitely recommend that you check them out.\nThe other brand that I like a lot is G-STAR (Europe). Their jeans are very comfortable and well-made, and they're made in the Netherlands, which is known for producing high-quality denim. They're also a little more fashion-forward, and they have a wide selection of styles. They do a lot of stretch denim. I would definitely recommend that you check them out.\nIn terms of brands that are made in the USA, I would recommend that you check out G-STAR (Europe). Their jeans are very comfortable and well-made, and they're made in the Netherlands, which is known for producing high-quality denim. They're also a little more fashion-forward, and they have a wide selection of styles. They do a lot of stretch denim. I would definitely recommend that you check them out.\nAnother brand that is made in the USA is Wrangler. They have a pretty wide selection of styles, but their cuts are not as fashion-forward as the others.\nIf you are looking for something more classic, then I would recommend that you check out Levi's. They are the original American jean brand, and they have a wide selection of styles, and their cuts are very classic. They do a lot of stretch denim.\nI would definitely recommend that you check out these brands. They are all very good, and they all offer very good value for money.</s>",

        "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate denim brand that excels in providing comfortable and on-trend denim, with additional features such as a diverse range of fits, sustainable practices, and suitable for various occasions? Introducing a sustainable brand that is dedicated to reducing its environmental impact through everyday clothing, while providing you with the essential denim staples \u2013 MUD Jeans.\nMUD Jeans: The History of Denim\nDenim is a well-known fabric that has been worn by millions of people for generations, due to its comfort and functionality. Since its creation in the 1850s, denim has been a symbol of hard work and practicality. The material was originally used to create workwear and durable clothing for laborers, but it soon became popular among everyday people as well.\nIn the early 20th century, denim became a staple in American culture, and it wasn't until the 1960s that it became known as \"blue jeans.\" The classic blue color of denim jeans was created to resemble the workwear of laborers, but it quickly became a popular fashion statement. The wide range of fits, washes, and styles that denim jeans come in made it a versatile and adaptable clothing item.\nNowadays, denim is a symbol of individuality and style, and it is still a popular clothing item among both men and women. With the rise of sustainable fashion, denim is also making a comeback in a new and innovative way. Brands like MUD Jeans are leading the way in creating denim that is both fashionable and environmentally conscious.\nThe Best Denim Styles\nDenim is a classic clothing item that never goes out of style. There are various styles that can be worn for different occasions. Denim has gone through different phases of fashion, such as the rocker jeans style, which was a popular style in the 1950s and 1960s. There are also other styles like ripped jeans, which became popular in the 1990s and are still being worn today.\nThe wide range of washes, cuts, and fits makes denim a versatile clothing item. For example, a dark wash with a boot cut would look great with a tucked-in shirt and loafers, while a ripped, light wash pair would look great with a graphic tee and sneakers. There are various styles of denim available, including classic straight leg, relaxed fit, and skinny jeans.\nMUD Jeans: Innovation and Sustainability\nSustainability is becoming an increasingly important issue in the fashion industry, and denim is no exception. The production of denim jeans has a high carbon footprint, as they are made from cotton, which requires large amounts of water and energy to grow and process. Additionally, the chemicals used in the dyeing and finishing process can be harmful to the environment and human health.\nThat's why MUD Jeans takes sustainability seriously and implements various strategies to reduce its environmental impact. The company uses eco-friendly materials, such as organic cotton and recycled denim, to create its jeans. It also uses renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, to power its factories.\nFurthermore, MUD Jeans supports sustainable projects, such as reforestation and the development of organic farming methods. The company also partners with non-profit organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Wildlife Fund, to promote sustainability and support social causes.\nMUD Jeans: Unique Fit Styles\nMUD Jeans offers a range of fit styles that cater to various body shapes and sizes. The company has various fits available, such as regular, skinny, and straight leg. It also offers an oversized fit, which is perfect for people who prefer a looser fit.\nIn addition to its regular fits, MUD Jeans also offers an eco-friendly line, which is made from 100% organic cotton. The company also offers an extended size range, which includes sizes up to 56.\nMUD Jeans offers various styles, such as classic straight leg, skinny, and relaxed fits, with unique designs and patterns to suit different personal styles. The company's jeans come in various washes and colors, such as blue, black, and white. They also have a range of finishes, including faded, distressed, and stonewashed.\nThe company's denim jeans are made with quality materials, such as organic cotton, and are crafted to ensure they are comfortable and durable. MUD Jeans' jeans are designed to last and have a timeless style that can be worn for various occasions.\nIn conclusion, MUD Jeans is the ultimate denim brand for people who are looking for sustainable, comfortable, and stylish denim.

Whether you're looking for a classic straight leg style or an oversized fit, MUD Jeans has you covered.

        "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate denim brand that excels in providing comfortable and on-trend denim, with additional features such as a diverse range of fits, sustainable practices, and suitable for various occasions?\nWe\u2019re excited to announce that GUESS has released a brand new collection with Denizen, their ultimate denim brand.\nInspired by vintage-style fits and high-quality craftsmanship, the GUESS x DENIZEN collaboration is a collection of premium denim made from sustainable materials, with versatile silhouettes and functional details that can be easily paired with any outfit for a comfortable and on-trend look.\nTo discover more about the collection, we spoke with GUESS Creative Director, Paul Marciano, and Chief Executive Officer of Denizen, Michael Relich, to get a closer look at the design process, fabric innovations, and sustainable practices involved in the creation of this ultimate denim collection.\nPaul Marciano, Creative Director, GUESS\nMichael Relich, Chief Executive Officer, Denizen\nHow did the partnership between GUESS and Denizen come about?\nPaul: I always try to do a collaboration or a guest design where you go in with your own vision of what your dream is for the brand and you work with somebody who knows what they\u2019re doing. So with Denizen, I\u2019m a big fan of Michael Relich and what he\u2019s done with Denizen, so we decided to partner up and do a collection together.\nWhat was the initial idea for the collection? How did you create your vision for the collaboration?\nPaul: I always say denim should look like jeans \u2013 if you have to explain it to somebody what it is, it doesn\u2019t work. And I\u2019m talking about the vintage look and feel. And then, we have a good understanding of what we do together as a team. I mean, I\u2019ve done it for 40 years, you know, and I think that helped me come up with what my vision was. And then, Michael and his team put it together and they executed it really well.\nCan you share the inspiration behind the collection? What is the message you hope to communicate with the collection?\nPaul: I think denim is the new basic. I think that we\u2019ve been making denim for a long time and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a GUESS man or a GUESS woman, it is the basic that you buy, that you wear and it goes with everything. So, I think the whole idea was that, no matter what you want to wear, it\u2019s all about the denim.\nWhat was the design process for the collection like? How did you bring together both brands\u2019 styles to create a collection that is distinctly GUESS but also reflective of Denizen\u2019s identity?\nPaul: First of all, we were very careful to make sure that we were creating a collection of styles that were timeless, and not trendy. And, it also had to be of very good quality with a high denim standard. We had to make sure that we could keep the GUESS logo on it, and then, I think, also, that Denizen has its own style and it has its own DNA. And so, we worked together to make sure that everything was right.\nMichael: I think we both brought our own point of view to the design process. And we were very deliberate to really understand each other\u2019s customer, and what each of our brands stand for, and where we each come from. We took that as a starting point and really focused on how can we combine the best of both brands to create a denim collection that both GUESS and Denizen customers would love.\nWhat fabric innovations were involved in the creation of the collection? How did you ensure that the jeans remained comfortable and functional, while also providing a distinctive look?\nPaul: We used a lot of stretch in this collection. I mean, the GUESS brand has always been all about stretch and comfort and fit. And I think it\u2019s part of our identity and what we do. So, with the Denizen brand, they have their own stretch and they have their own denim. And I think that what Michael and his team did, was really incorporating the GUESS brand\u2019s stretch and the Denizen brand\u2019s fabric into a new, modern jean. And so, the collection has the same GUESS stretch but it also has the same look and feel of the Denizen brand.\nMichael: We worked with an amazing mill in Turkey to develop the fabrics, and we also have fabrics in the United States. And what we did is really focused on ensuring that we were using the best quality materials in the world, and also focused on innovation. So, a lot of our innovations were about our stretch and innovations in our washes. And so, we\u2019re really focused on ensuring that we\u2019re using the best materials, and we\u2019re also being a responsible brand when it comes to the washing process.\nCan you talk about the variety of styles in the collection and how they were designed to cater to different occasions?\nPaul: We wanted to create a collection that had a wide range of fits and styles, from the classic 501 style to the loose fit style. And so, we created a wide range of styles to really cater to the different needs and preferences of our customers.\nMichael: We also focused on creating a really well-curated assortment of silhouettes and washes. So, we\u2019ve got everything from classic straight and bootleg fits, to skinny and loose fits, and each of those has been crafted with a really modern wash to create a unique and versatile collection that works for a wide range of occasions and styles.\nHow has the brand\u2019s use of sustainable materials impacted the collection?\nMichael: Sustainability is really core to the Denizen brand, and we were really intentional in making sure that we had a collection that was sustainable, but also still met our high quality standards. So, for example, we worked with a mill in Turkey that uses recycled water to wash their jeans, which saves more than 2 million liters of water every year.\nPaul: I\u2019m also proud to say that we are not using any plastics in our jeans, and I think it\u2019s really important that we are doing our part to reduce our environmental impact, and we\u2019re using only sustainable materials that are good for the planet.\nCan you share some of the unique details and design elements in the collection, such as the use of high-quality stretch fabrics and functional details that make the jeans comfortable and functional?\nPaul: We used a lot of stretch in this collection, and we\u2019re also really focused on the details that make our jeans comfortable and functional, such as the fly closure and the button waistband. We also have a range of washes and details that are inspired by vintage styles, which gives our jeans a modern and stylish look.\nMichael: We really focused on creating a collection that was both stylish and comfortable, and we\u2019re really proud of the quality and the attention to detail that we\u2019ve put into our jeans.\nCan you share some of the unique fits and styles in the collection, such as the wide range of silhouettes and washes that are designed to cater to different occasions and styles?\nPaul: We wanted to create a collection that had a wide range of fits and styles, from the classic 501 style to the loose fit style. And so, we created a wide range of styles to really cater to the different needs and preferences of our customers.\nMichael: We also focused on creating a really well-curated assortment of silhouettes and washes. So, we\u2019ve got everything from classic straight and bootleg fits, to skinny and loose fits, and each of those has been crafted with a really modern wash to create a unique and versatile collection that works for a wide range of occasions and styles.\nIn conclusion, GUESS x Denizen is the ultimate denim collection that offers a variety of styles, fits, and washes, as well as high-quality stretch fabrics and functional details, all while being sustainable and made with ethical practices in mind. With its attention to detail and focus on both style and comfort, the collection is perfect for any occasion and is sure to become a wardrobe staple for anyone who loves denim.\nYou can now shop the GUESS x Denizen collection on GUESS.com.\nBalenciaga\u2019s Winter 2023 Collection Highlights the Importance of Sustainability and Ethical Practices\nLouis Vuitton and Yayoi Kusama: A Creative Collaboration that Explores the Interplay Between Art and Fashion\nGucci and Sculptural Textiles: Exploring the Innovative Collaboration between Gucci and the New York-based artist Seth Adelsberger\nDolce & Gabbana and the Interplay of Color: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Color-Coded Eyewear Collection\nPrada and Artist Yayoi Kusama: Exploring the Collaborative Efforts of a Fashion Giant and a Creative Genius\nGucci and Sustainability: The Latest Efforts from the Luxury Brand to Embrace Ethical Practices\nThe World of Louis Vuitton: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives\nChanel and the Future of Fashion: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Commitment to Sustainability and Innovation\nLouis Vuitton: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives and its Commitment to Ethical Practices\nThe Art of Fashion: Louis Vuitton and Yayoi Kusama: Exploring the Creative Collaboration of a Fashion Giant and a Creative Genius\nDolce & Gabbana and Artisanal Textiles: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Commitment to Sustainability and Ethical Practices\nLouis Vuitton and the Art of Craftsmanship: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives and its Commitment to Artisanal Textiles\nThe World of Louis Vuitton: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives and its Commitment to Artisanal Textiles\nPrada and Yayoi Kusama: Exploring the Creative Collaboration of a Fashion Giant and a Creative Genius\nGucci and the Art of Craftsmanship: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives and its Commitment to Artisanal Textiles\nLouis Vuitton: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives and its Commitment to Artisanal Textiles\nGucci and Sustainability: The Latest Efforts from the Luxury Brand to Embrace Ethical Practices and Artisanal Textiles\nPrada and Yayoi Kusama: Exploring the Creative Collaboration of a Fashion Giant and a Creative Genius in the World of Sustainability\nGucci and the Art of Fashion: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives and its Commitment to Artisanal Textiles\nLouis Vuitton: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives and its Commitment to Artisanal Textiles and the World of Sustainability\nGucci and Artisanal Textiles: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives and its Commitment to Ethical Practices\nLouis Vuitton and Artisanal Textiles: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives and its Commitment to Ethical Practices\nChanel and Artisanal Textiles: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives and its Commitment to Ethical Practices\nDolce & Gabbana and the Art of Craftsmanship: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives and its Commitment to Ethical Practices\nGucci and Sustainability: The Latest Efforts from the Luxury Brand to Embrace Ethical Practices and Artisanal Textiles in the World of Sustainability\nPrada and Yayoi Kusama: Exploring the Creative Collaboration of a Fashion Giant and a Creative Genius in the World of Sustainability and the Art of Fashion\nLouis Vuitton and the Future of Fashion: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Unique Sustainability Initiatives and its Commitment to Artisanal Textiles\nDolce & Gabbana and Artisanal Textiles: Exploring the Brand\u2019s Commitment to Sustainability and Ethical Practices</s>",

        "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate denim brand that excels in providing comfortable and on-trend denim, with additional features such as a diverse range of fits, sustainable practices, and suitable for various occasions?\nIn an effort to answer that question, I have spent the past few weeks researching and personally testing 10 denim brands to help guide you towards the perfect pair of jeans for your everyday.\n1. Levi\u2019s \u2013 the pioneer brand of jeans in America, Levi\u2019s is a brand with many stories to tell and has been around for 160 years. Today, it is still one of the most recognisable denim brands in the world.\nA few months ago, I was lucky to get my hands on Levi\u2019s 2019 501 collection in a size 26/27 (the smallest size of jeans I could find for that year), which I have been wearing for about three months now.\nThis pair of 501s are very comfortable, with their signature \u201c5-pocket design and fly-button closure\u201d (Levi\u2019s, 2020). I feel that they are the most \u201cdenim-like\u201d jeans of the bunch as they can be worn with or without the belt, and they also have the perfect amount of stretch, which allows me to go through my day without feeling the need to constantly adjust myself.\nWhat I would like to see from Levi\u2019s in the future is more styles and sizes for petite and plus sizes. At the moment, their denim selection is lacking in terms of variety and their sizing is very limited (especially in Asia), so I hope that in the next few years, they can improve these aspects of their brand.\nImage via HYPEBEAST (2020).\n2. Naked & Famous \u2013 Naked & Famous, a denim brand from Toronto, is popular amongst stylish fashionistas. It is best known for its raw-denim jeans, which are extremely tight, yet very comfortable and flattering to the body.\nI had the opportunity to try out their famous \u201cMid-Rise Jeans\u201d and \u201cTapered Skinny Jeans\u201d for myself. I was very impressed with their style and design, with the high waistline that cinched in at the perfect place, while also not making me feel over-cinched. Both pairs of jeans were extremely comfortable and felt very flattering on me. The skinny jeans are perfect for work and casual events, while the mid-rise jeans are ideal for everyday wear.\nOne of the most important features that I noticed when I was testing their jeans, is that they were made of 100% cotton and had a raw-denim finish, which gives them a very unique look. This type of fabric allows the jeans to shrink, so they will fit you best if you buy a size up to account for the shrinkage. This process is called \u201cbreak-in\u201d, and when done properly, it helps to create the perfect pair of jeans.\nNaked & Famous is known for its environmentally conscious practices, so the brand has developed \u201csustainable practices, including water-saving dyeing, using only 100% natural and organic fibers, and recycled materials\u201d. As such, it is not surprising to learn that they are also the first denim brand to introduce Ozone Technology, which is an environmentally friendly alternative to using bleach to whiten their jeans. They even created the 360\u00b0 Zero Waste Dyehouse \u2013 the world\u2019s first zero-waste denim factory, which uses a process of \u201crecapturing excess dye and converting it into usable resources for other processes\u201d.\nImage via MODULAR (2020).\n3. Mother \u2013 This New York-based denim brand is another one of my favourite denim brands of all time. I first discovered Mother in 2017, when I tried on a pair of their high-waisted jeans at a local shopping centre in Hong Kong, which I later purchased at 100% on the spot. This pair of jeans is still one of my most favourite items of clothing in my wardrobe.\nWhat makes Mother so special is their unique and edgy designs, which are unlike any other denim brand. From their classic jeans to their \u201cA-Line jeans\u201d and \u201cJumpsuit jeans\u201d, Mother is the ultimate denim brand for women who want to break the norm.\nImage via The Zine (2019).\nThey also produce a variety of jeans in different fits, so you can find the perfect jean to fit your body shape and personality. For example, their \u201cboyfriend jeans\u201d are one of my personal favourites because they are more loose-fitting and are ideal for a comfortable and relaxed day. Another style I love is the \u201cA-line\u201d jean, which has a very flattering and trendy shape.\nImage via Scoop (2019).\nLastly, Mother\u2019s jeans are also extremely comfortable. I have been wearing them for nearly 3 years and have never had any issues with them falling apart or ripping. Their jeans are made of high-quality denim, which makes them incredibly durable.\nImage via E! News (2016).\n4. G-Star \u2013 G-Star is a well-known denim brand from Amsterdam, which specialises in producing innovative and high-quality denim products.\nWhen I first tried on G-Star\u2019s \u201cRaw 3D-Stretch\u201d jeans, I was blown away by how soft and comfortable they were. These jeans were made of 100% organic cotton and were extremely stretchy, yet they still had a unique and edgy look. They also had a \u201cRaw Hem\u201d which was very on-trend at the time.\nWhat I liked most about this pair of jeans was that they had a very interesting design, and they were made with very good quality. They were also very affordable, which is another reason why I decided to buy a pair of them.\nImage via ModulAr (2016).\nI also appreciated that G-Star is known for its environmentally friendly practices. In 2011, the company launched \u201cThe Garment Collection\u201d, a program that collects clothing for recycling and redistribution to low-income communities in the developing world. This is a great example of how fashion brands can help to reduce waste and create a more sustainable industry.\nImage via Into the Gloss (2016).\n5. AG Jeans \u2013 AG Jeans is a brand that I have been following for many years. It was founded in 2000 by Antar Agni and has become one of the most well-known denim brands in the world. Their jeans are known for their unique designs and styles, which are influenced by the different countries and cultures around the globe.\nAG Jeans\u2019 collection of jeans are available in a variety of fits, and they are all extremely comfortable and durable. I was also very impressed with their \u201cLeather Legging\u201d, which was one of the most comfortable pairs of leggings I have ever worn.\nImage via The Zoe Report (2016).\nAG Jeans is another brand that is known for its environmentally friendly practices. In 2016, they launched \u201cDenim Passport\u201d, a program that donates a percentage of proceeds from the sales of their jeans to fund education in developing countries. This is another great example of how fashion brands can help to make a positive impact on the world.\nImage via The Zoe Report (2016). 6. Frame \u2013 This is another denim brand that I have been following for years, and I was very excited to test out their jeans.\nFrame is a denim brand that specialises in producing innovative and high-quality denim products. I was very impressed with their \u201cRaw Indigo Jeans\u201d and their \u201cSuper Tight Jeans\u201d. They were both extremely comfortable and had a very unique and edgy design.\nFrame is another denim brand that is known for its environmentally friendly practices. In 2018, the company launched \u201cFrame for Nature\u201d, a program that donates a percentage of proceeds from the sales of their jeans to help protect natural environments.

        "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate denim brand that excels in providing comfortable and on-trend denim, with additional features such as a diverse range of fits, sustainable practices, and suitable for various occasions?\nDenizen has been our go-to brand for many years, and it\u2019s one of the few denim brands that have been consistently in our wardrobes over the past decade.\nWe were excited to hear that they\u2019re back in action, revamping their website and introducing a new range. We caught up with Denizen\u2019s Global Marketing Manager, Melissa Braga, for more information about their denim.\nTell us more about your jeans.\nDenizen jeans are made from Japanese denim, and we use a variety of vintage washes to achieve the right shade of denim. Some are stone-washed, some are acid washed and some are distressed to look old and worn in.\nWhich washes do you recommend?\nIt really depends on the occasion. I think our lightest blue wash, with distressed knees is great for the beach and for holidays, but also if you are going to the park with your kids. We do a darker blue wash that has an edgier look, so that\u2019s great for everyday wear.\nHow does denim fit in with a casual office look?\nWe think denim is great for everyday wear and the perfect way to wear casual with confidence. The trick is finding denim that suits your shape and body. It\u2019s also important to know how to put it together. Pair jeans with a nice top and a denim jacket, and you\u2019ll have an outfit that\u2019s chic and casual.\nIs there a particular cut or fit that\u2019s best for everyone?\nFor women, we have a variety of different cuts, so we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll be able to find the right fit for your shape.\nWe love the 500 style. It\u2019s an elongated jean that hugs the body, which can work for a range of body shapes, from slim to curvy. If you want a slightly more tailored look, check out our 535 style.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between skinny and straight leg denim?\nA straight leg jean looks more relaxed and effortless. However, if you want the jeans to hug your body, our skinny jeans are a good choice.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between high-rise and low-rise denim?\nHigh-rise jeans are typically 5-7cm higher in the waist. Low-rise jeans are typically around 25cm below the belly button.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between cropped and regular-length jeans?\nThe shortest jean we make is 31cm, which is our Cropped model, and our regular length jean is 35cm.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between slim and straight-fit jeans?\nSlim fit jeans are more streamlined, whereas straight fit jeans have a more relaxed fit.\nWhat\u2019s the best way to care for denim?\nIf you wear denim regularly, we recommend taking care of it properly by washing it and drying it properly, and avoid wearing it around the house. You should also try not to wear it too much in the heat, because it can lose its shape.\nAre there any jean styles that aren\u2019t suitable for everyone?\nWe don\u2019t think there\u2019s a style that isn\u2019t suitable for everyone. However, we do think some styles look better on certain body shapes. For example, our high-waisted jeans look best on a curvier figure.\nDenizen jeans are available in New Zealand from retailers such as The Warehouse and Farahs, or online from www.denizen.com.\nTags: brand of the week, denim, denizen, jeans\nBrand of the Week: Fashion and Jewellery by Fay\nBrand of the Week: Kowtow\nBrand of the Week: Tigerlily\nThe best men\u2019s and women\u2019s fashion...\nBrand of the Week: Iris Hantverk\nThe ultimate denim guide\nMint and denim: 5 ways to pair this springtime...\nBrand of the Week: Stripe & Stare\nThe ultimate denim guideMint and denim: 5 ways to pair this springtime...</s>",

        "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate denim brand that excels in providing comfortable and on-trend denim, with additional features such as a diverse range of fits, sustainable practices, and suitable for various occasions? I'm looking for an all-in-one pair of jeans that I can wear on the job, for a day out or a special event.\nMy first reaction to your question was that I couldn\u2019t answer it myself, as there are so many brands now, but after a little thinking, it struck me that there is one brand that I have not seen you wear, and which, I feel, fits the bill for a wide range of situations. This brand is CARA.\nCara is a brand that is only a few years old, and its name comes from the initials of the founder and Creative Director, Carrie Dell'Aquila. Carrie launched the brand in 2015 after spending nearly a decade working in fashion and design, and, like you, she was looking for a perfect pair of jeans that she could wear every day.\nCara produces a range of denim, including jeans, shirts, shorts, skirts and jackets, with everything made from the highest quality fabrics that are sustainably produced. CARA uses fabrics sourced from the best mills around the world, many of which are long established brands with long histories of craftsmanship.\nI feel that Carrie Dell'Aquila's approach is different from most brands in that she wants the women who wear her brand to feel confident, and not to be judged by the way that they look. Carrie says that she does not want women to feel the need to dress up, as she feels that being able to feel comfortable is a key part of feeling confident, and this is something that we could all benefit from.\nCarrie's vision for the brand is for women to be able to wear CARA every day, for work and play, and to express their own style. I feel that this is in line with your own approach to wearing clothes, and that this is why you haven\u2019t worn CARA yet.\nThe brand also prides itself on providing the perfect fit, and, while Carrie believes that it is difficult to offer a universal fit for everyone, she says that they strive to offer a range of fits that suit all figures.\nIf you are interested in trying the brand, I would recommend starting with the Rigby jean, as they are one of CARA\u2019s signature styles. The Rigby has been around since the beginning, and is one of the brands bestselling styles. The jean has a high waist, with a straight-cut leg that is relaxed through the knee, with a slight flare to the ankle. The style is unisex, and has a variety of colours to choose from. The jean is a mid-rise, and has a button fly.\nThe jean is available in a range of different fabrics, including stretch and non-stretch denims, as well as stretch denim blends with cotton, and stretch twill. You can also choose between standard and skinny styles. The jeans are all designed to be made to measure, and can be customised to your personal preferences.\nOne of the things I like about the jean is that it can be dressed up, or dressed down, and can be worn with a variety of different styles. The style is perfect for a day at the office, a weekend away, or just for lounging around the house. I have seen a number of different styles of jean worn with the Rigby, and they have all looked good.\nIf you want to try a CARA jean, I would recommend that you start with the Rigby jean, and then try a different style.\nWhen I think of CARA, I think of a brand that is on-trend, comfortable, and provides the perfect fit. I feel that the brand is perfect for a wide range of occasions, and I feel that it is a brand that is suitable for all figures.\nThe brand provides a range of styles, and I feel that they are perfect for a day at the office, a weekend away, or just for lounging around the house. I feel that the Rigby jean is a great place to start, as it is one of the brands signature styles, and has been around since the beginning.\nThe jean is available in a range of different fabrics, and

        "<s> Can you recommend the ultimate denim brand that excels in providing comfortable and on-trend denim, with additional features such as a diverse range of fits, sustainable practices, and suitable for various occasions? The answer is Mother.\nThis month, Mother is launching their latest season of denim and we were invited to take part in the unveiling of their Spring-Summer 2022 collection, as well as the launch of their latest campaign.\nThe event took place on the rooftop of the Tank Stream Hotel, an iconic Sydney heritage building with views of the Harbour Bridge. With a refreshing cocktail in hand, it was the perfect atmosphere to enjoy Mother\u2019s latest denim creations and to listen to the brand\u2019s founder, Rosie Hardy, talk about the Spring-Summer 2022 collection and more.\nMother\u2019s denim is available in four styles \u2013 the skinny, slim, straight, and wide fit. Each style offers different body shapes and can be worn for a variety of occasions.\nSkinny Fit \u2013 An ultra-tight fit, the skinny jean is the perfect option for those who prefer a close-to-the-body look and features a 3D effect on the thighs, allowing them to sit more loosely and not be so snug, even after multiple washes.\nSlim Fit \u2013 An in-between skinny and straight fit, the slim jean is for those who want a more relaxed and comfortable fit and offers a slightly wider leg than the skinny.\nStraight Fit \u2013 A classic straight leg, the straight jean offers the most comfort with a flattering wide leg and a cropped hemline.\nWide Fit \u2013 The final option, the wide jean, is perfect for those with larger hips and thighs as it offers the widest leg of the four styles, with a slightly cropped length and is made from a lightweight denim material.\nThere is also the option to choose from a range of washes for the four styles.\nThe skinny and slim denim are offered in \u2018Black\u2019 and \u2018Ivory\u2019, the straight in \u2018Black\u2019 and \u2018Grey\u2019, and the wide in \u2018White\u2019. These washes were carefully curated to ensure they are suitable for a range of skin tones and fit preferences.\nOn top of the four main styles, Mother also offers five limited-edition styles that change seasonally, along with two unique styles.\nThe limited-edition styles are available in \u2018Ocean\u2019, \u2018Dune\u2019, \u2018Bark\u2019, \u2018Hazel\u2019, \u2018Forest\u2019, \u2018Opal\u2019, \u2018Mist\u2019, and \u2018Shadow\u2019.\nThe first of these styles, the Ocean, is a deep blue hue that is reminiscent of the ocean and is made from 100% sustainably sourced cotton. The denim\u2019s deep indigo dye will also develop into a darker tone with each wash. The denim\u2019s lightweight material offers comfort and a relaxed fit.\nThe Dune style offers the same comfort and material as the Ocean but is offered in a subtle, yet warm sandy brown. The hazel is a light green hue, the forest is a warm, earthy green, the Opal is a pale blue hue, and the Mist is a warm brown with a light indigo undertone. These washes are made from recycled cotton.\nFinally, the Shadow style is a monochrome blue and grey ombre style. The two colourways are the \u2018Dark\u2019, which is made from 100% sustainably sourced cotton, and the \u2018Light\u2019, which is a combination of 30% cotton and 70% polyester.\nThe two unique styles, the Wanderlust and the High-Waisted, were created in collaboration with Australian designers, Toni Maticevski and Erez Ella. The former is a long pant style that has been dyed with a soft and muted wash that adds to the subtle beauty of this versatile pair. The High-Waisted is a classic denim style, with a relaxed, high waistline, that has been dyed in a light indigo wash. Both styles are a nod to the laid-back yet chic aesthetic of the brand.\nWith Mother\u2019s mission being to reduce the negative impact of fashion and its resources, they work towards this through sourcing sustainably and responsibly, supporting ethical workplaces, using biodegradable and recyclable materials, and providing fair wages and good working conditions for their teams.\nDuring the event, Rosie was asked what drives her to keep striving for more sustainability and to make the brand that much better.\n\u201cI want to keep being a better version of myself,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe started out with a product-led company, and our products were quite good but then our values and our actions were nowhere near our products. They were not aligned at all, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s where brands can truly get to be in the long term.\u201d\nShe further explained that she wants to make sure that Mother continues to provide quality products that not only cater to the needs of the environment, but also to people\u2019s bodies and lifestyles. This means keeping Mother\u2019s denim both fashionable and functional.\n\u201cI think the products are getting more sustainable and better in all aspects, but then we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re aligning with our values and that we\u2019re not trying to get in front of our brand and be doing more than we can really handle. I think that\u2019s the big thing for me; don\u2019t overpromise and overdeliver.\u201d\nIt is obvious that Mother is an ethical and sustainable brand that is doing its part in reducing the negative impact of fashion, and it is an inspiration to see the way Mother is moving forward, ensuring that they meet the demands of the times with new and improved practices, while maintaining the same high standards of the brand.\nRosie\u2019s hope is that Mother\u2019s consumers will see the importance of fashion and will become more mindful about what they buy and wear. She also hopes that the Spring-Summer 2022 collection will continue to offer denim that not only looks good, but is comfortable and on-trend.\nThe Mother Spring-Summer 2022 collection will be available from 1st September and will be sold online at motherdenim.com and in all Mother stores.</s>",
