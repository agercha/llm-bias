Factors such as performance, user interface, and software compatibility are crucial considerations for me. Any suggestions on which operating system would meet these criteria?\nOSes are not a major differentiator in the performance of a computer, the OS is really a \"paint by numbers\" thing that doesn't affect performance or reliability that much, if at all. It would depend on what software you want to run and what your hardware requirements are, those are far more important for performance than the OS.\nAs to software compatibility, most of the common OS's are compatible with each other, it is more a matter of finding out which OS's support the software you need.\nMy current machine is a Lenovo ThinkPad T60p, running Ubuntu 9.04 64 bit. I chose it because of it's lightweight design and excellent battery life, and the Ubuntu OS, because it was what I wanted.\nI would highly recommend the Ubuntu OS, it is very reliable and it is free. It is also free from Microsoft's \"licensing costs\". It will run on all types of hardware, new and old, though some older hardware can have driver issues. I'm not sure about Windows 7, but Windows 2000 and Windows XP were both much less stable than Ubuntu, I have experienced some issues with Ubuntu, but for the most part it is reliable and stable.\nMy only problem with Ubuntu is the lack of software. It doesn't matter as much to me, but it is a problem.\nI've tried Linux and have enjoyed it but I would like to know more about how many other people use it as their main operating system.\nIt is becoming more and more common and used. Here in Canada, many major corporations run it for some or all of their computers. I know one large company that runs Windows XP but only for their accountants, because they use Microsoft Office. They run Ubuntu and Linux Mint on everything else. It is popular with \"home computing\" people because of it's reliability and because it is free. It's not popular for gaming.\nThat said, I don't think that Linux, or any OS, really matters that much, it is a tool that is meant to help you accomplish your goals.\nOne thing to consider is how to upgrade it. You might want to consider having a partition, or at least a USB drive with a recovery CD, to allow you to re-install. This is important with any OS, not just Linux.\nAnother option would be to use a virtual machine. I have a machine at home that runs Ubuntu Linux and Windows XP. The virtual machine allows me to run Windows without installing it. It allows me to test out Windows applications, and run them in a safe environment where the system crash can't damage my actual machine.\nMy current system is a Toshiba Satellite with Windows 7 Ultimate x64 Edition, Intel Core i7-720QM CPU, 4GB of DDR3, and a 320GB Samsung M8 Portable Hard Drive.\nThis laptop is more than sufficient for any task I have thrown at it. It was a gift to me, but I still have to pay for the replacement battery, it's so light it doesn't have room for a big battery.\nI used Linux before, but Windows 7 is better than Windows XP for my needs. It's very stable, and it has some new features that make it better than Windows XP, or Vista.\nOne feature that I really like is the ability to access remote systems, for instance to remotely access my work computer or a friend's computer. It's a very useful tool, and I have it set up to access my work computer.\nAlso, with Windows 7, you can use your fingerprint instead of typing your password. It works very well and is much safer, and easier, than a password.\nThis is the type of information I am looking for. Thanks!\nThe information about \"the future of Linux on the desktop\" was very helpful.\nI recently switched from a Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit machine to Ubuntu 12.10. I have not had to reboot this machine at all. The only reason I know I've rebooted the computer at all is that I turned it off and then turned it on. There is no problem with the computer locking up or having any other kind of crash or glitch.\nIt is stable. It's lightweight and works very well. I also have the option to access my work computer and other computers. This is very helpful.</s>",
