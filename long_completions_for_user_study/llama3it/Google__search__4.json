Additionally, Google offers a wide range of advanced search options, such as site search, file search, and image search.\n2. **DuckDuckGo**: DuckDuckGo is a privacy-focused search engine that offers a clean and minimalistic interface. It's known for its high-quality search results and lack of tracking cookies, making it a great choice for those concerned about online privacy. DuckDuckGo also provides features like instant answers, maps, and videos.\n3. **StartPage**: StartPage is another privacy-focused search engine that uses Google's search results without tracking users. It offers a simple and clean interface, along with features like image search, news search, and a built-in translator.\n4. **Bing**: Bing is Microsoft's search engine, which offers a range of features like image search, video search, and shopping search.

Is the interface intuitive and clean?\n3. **Search capabilities**: Does the search engine offer advanced search options, such as site search, file search, or image search?\n4. **Privacy**: How does the search engine handle user data?
