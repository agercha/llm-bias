A convection microwave distinguishes itself with features such as convection cooking, spacious interior, and advanced reheating options, ensuring a superior microwave experience in the kitchen. Convection microwaves have a fan that circulates air, which helps to distribute heat more evenly throughout the food. This results in more even heating and reheating, as well as the ability to cook food more quickly. Convection microwaves also have a larger interior than traditional microwaves, which makes it easier to cook larger dishes. Advanced reheating options on convection microwaves allow you to reheat food more quickly and evenly, without overcooking."
